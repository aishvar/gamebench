You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the current situation. The game is between me (Player 1) and Player 0. My hand is 81043125, which means I have the digits 8, 1, 0, 4, 3, 1, 2, 5. So, let's break that down: I have one 8, two 1s, one 0, one 4, one 3, one 2, and one 5. \n\nThe current bid on the table is 3 8s, made by Player 0. My goal is to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid. I need to consider the rules of the game to make the best move.\n\nFirst, let's think about challenging. If I challenge, the total number of 8s in both players' hands will be revealed. If the total is at least 3, Player 0 wins, and I lose. If it's less than 3, I win. So, I need to assess how likely it is that there are at least 3 eights.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have one 8. So, Player 0 must have at least two more 8s for the total to be 3. But each player only has 8 digits. Player 0's hand isn't visible, so I don't know what they have. However, since the bid is 3 8s, Player 0 might have at least two 8s, or maybe they're bluffing.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to make a higher bid. A higher bid can either have a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. The current bid is 3 8s, so I could bid 4 of any digit, or 3 of a digit higher than 8, but since 8 is the highest digit, the only option is to increase the quantity.\n\nLooking at my hand again, I have two 1s. That's the highest quantity I have for any digit. So, if I were to bid based on my own hand, I could potentially bid 2 1s. But wait, the current bid is 3 8s, so I need to bid higher than that. Bidding 2 1s would actually be lower because both the quantity and the digit are lower. That's not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to bid a higher quantity. The next possible quantity after 3 is 4. So, I could look for a digit that I think there might be at least four of in total. But considering my own hand, I only have one of each digit except for 1s. So, if I bid 4 of a digit, I need to choose a digit that I think the opponent might have multiple of.\n\nWait, but if I have only one 8, and the opponent bid 3 8s, maybe they have two 8s, making the total 3. Or maybe they have three 8s, making the total four. But I don't know. If I challenge, and the total is 3 or more, I lose. If it's 2 or less, I win.\n\nGiven that, is it more likely that the total is 3 or more? Since I have one 8, the opponent needs at least two. Each player has 8 digits, so it's possible, but not certain. However, 8 is a high digit, and players might not have that many. Maybe the opponent is bluffing.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to bid 4 of a digit I think is more common. Looking at my hand, I have 0,1,2,3,4,5,8. The digits present are spread out. Maybe digits like 1 are more common. I have two 1s, so if the opponent has two more, that would make four. But that's a big if. Alternatively, maybe 0s are common, but I have only one.\n\nIf I bid 4 1s, I'm hoping that the total is at least four. But if the opponent doesn't have two 1s, then the total would be two, and I'd lose if challenged. Similarly, if I bid 4 0s, but I only have one, so the opponent would need three, which seems unlikely.\n\nAnother thought: since the current bid is 3 8s, maybe the opponent is trying to represent strength. If I challenge and lose, I give them the win. If I challenge and win, I take the win. But the risk is high because if there are three 8s, I lose.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to bid 4 of a digit I think is more plausible. For example, 4 5s. I have one 5, so the opponent would need three. Not sure. Or 4 3s, but I have one 3. It's all uncertain.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the possible maximum. There are 16 digits in total (8 each). If I have one 8, and the opponent has two, that's three. If they have three, that's four. But 8 is a high digit, and in a game, people might not have too many of them, especially since they're valuable. So maybe the opponent is bluffing and only has one or two 8s.\n\nIf I challenge, and the total is 3, I lose. If it's 2, I win. So, the question is, is the opponent likely to have two or more 8s? Since each player has 8 digits, it's possible, but not guaranteed. Maybe the opponent has two, making the total 3. Or maybe they have one, making it 2.\n\nI think challenging might be the safer option here because the opponent might not have enough 8s. Alternatively, if I bid 4 of a digit, I might be taking a risk if the opponent can challenge me next turn.\n\nWait, but if I bid 4 of a digit, the opponent can then challenge me, and if I don't have enough, I lose. So, maybe challenging is better because I can end the game now if the opponent is bluffing.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think I should challenge the bid because the likelihood of there being exactly three 8s is possible, but given that 8 is a high digit, it's not too common, so the opponent might be bluffing. If I challenge and there are only two 8s, I win. If there are three, I lose. It's a 50-50 chance, but maybe slightly in my favor because 8s are rare.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to bid 4 of a digit I think is more likely to have four in total. But without knowing the opponent's hand, it's hard to say. Maybe 4 1s, since I have two, but the opponent might have two as well. Or maybe 4 0s, but I only have one.\n\nI think challenging is the better move here because the risk of the opponent having exactly three 8s is moderate, and if they don't, I win. Plus, if I challenge and lose, it's only this round, but if I make a wrong bid, I could lose as well. So, challenging seems like the safer option to test the opponent's bid.\n"
