Given that the maximum possible quantity for any digit across both players' hands is 16 and the current bid is only 2, it's reasonable to assume that there could be more than 2 zeros in total, but not extremely high. However, without information on Player 0's hand, I must focus on my own. Since I have one '0', and assuming Player 0 might have one as well (making 2), bidding a higher quantity of a lower digit or a higher digit with a reasonable quantity seems strategic. I have multiple high digits but focusing on a digit I know I have seems wise.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 1 6\"\n}\n```",
