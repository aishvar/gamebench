You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm Player 0 in this Liar's Poker game, and the current bid is None. My hand is 6, 0, 4, 7, 7, 3, 1, 8. Let me start by analyzing my own digits to figure out a good opening bid. \n\nFirst, let's count the frequency of each digit in my hand. Breaking it down:\n\n- 0: 1\n- 1: 1\n- 3: 1\n- 4: 1\n- 6: 1\n- 7: 2\n- 8: 1\n\nSo the most frequent digit in my hand is 7, which appears twice. Since there are two players, each with 8 digits, the total number of digits in play is 16. The maximum possible for any digit is 16, but realistically, unless someone has a lot of the same digit, the counts might be lower.\n\nSince there's no prior bid, I need to make an opening bid that's plausible but also gives me some leverage. A common strategy in Liar's Poker is to start with a bid that's based on the strongest part of your hand. Here, I have two 7s. If I bid on 7s, I can assume that the opponent might have at least one or two more, making the total around 3 or 4. But since I don't know their hand, I have to be cautious.\n\nAlternatively, considering the digits in my hand, maybe starting with a lower digit that's less likely to be challenged. For example, 0s: I have one 0. If I bid 2 0s, that would mean there's at least one more 0 in the opponent's hand. Since 0s are common in numbers, maybe that's a safer bet. But if I bid 2 0s, the next player could challenge if they have none, but that's a risk.\n\nWait, but the rules say the bid must be strictly higher than the current bid. Since the current bid is None, I can start with any valid bid. The challenge is to pick a bid that's not too high to be immediately challenged but also not too low that it gives the opponent an easy way to raise. \n\nLooking at my hand, the highest count is 2 (for 7s). So if I bid 2 7s, that's based on my own hand. But the opponent could have 0, 1, or more 7s. If they have one, the total is 3, which would make my bid of 2 valid. If they have none, the total is 2, which still meets the bid. So bidding 2 7s is safe because even if the opponent has none, the total is exactly 2, which meets the bid. Wait, but the bid is \"at least\" the quantity, right? So as long as the total is equal to or higher than the bid, the bidder is correct. Wait no, according to the rules: \"If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins.\" So if I bid 2 7s and the total is 2, I win. So if I have 2, and the opponent has 0, total is 2, which meets the bid. Therefore, bidding 2 7s is a safe opening because even if the opponent has none, the count is exactly 2, so challenging would fail. But the opponent knows their own hand. If they have zero 7s, they might challenge, but if they have any, they might bid higher. But since I have two, and there's 8 more digits, the probability that there's at least two in total is high. Alternatively, maybe starting with a higher quantity but lower digit. For example, 3 of a lower digit. Let's see: in my hand, 0,1,3,4,6,8 each have one. If I bid 3 1s, for example, I have one, so the opponent needs at least two. That's possible but risky. If I bid 3 of a digit, but I only have one, the opponent would need to have two or more. That's a riskier bid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bidding 2 7s is better because I have two, so even if the opponent has none, the total is 2, which meets the bid. So that's a safe opening. Alternatively, could I bid 3 7s? That would require the opponent to have at least one. If they have one, total is 3, which meets the bid. If they have none, then the total is 2, which is less than 3, so if they challenge, I lose. But since I don't know their hand, bidding 3 7s is a bit risky. But maybe the opponent is less likely to challenge if I start with a higher bid. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a lower digit but higher quantity. For example, 3 0s. I have one 0. So opponent needs two. That's possible, but not certain. If they have one, total is 2, which is less than 3, so they can challenge and I lose. That's risky. \n\nSo perhaps the safest opening is to bid 2 7s, since I have two, so even if the opponent has none, the total is 2, which meets the bid. Therefore, challenging would be a loss for them. That makes it a safe bid. Alternatively, if I bid 2 7s, the next player can either bid higher (like 3 of a higher digit or 2 of a higher digit) or challenge. But since the total is at least 2, challenging would be a bad move. So that's a solid opening. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid a higher digit. For example, 2 8s. I have one 8. If the opponent has at least one, the total is 2. If not, it's 1. So bidding 2 8s would be a lie if they have none. But since I have one, the opponent needs one. If they have none, then the total is 1, so my bid of 2 would be wrong. But they might not challenge immediately. Hmm, but that's riskier. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a middle digit, like 2 5s. I have none in my hand. So the opponent would need to have at least two 5s. That's possible, but risky. If they have none, then the total is zero, so my bid is wrong. \n\nSo comparing the options, the safest is to bid on the digit I have the most of, which is 7s. Bidding 2 7s is safe because even if the opponent has none, the total is 2. Therefore, the bid is valid. That way, the opponent can't challenge successfully unless they have zero 7s. But even if they do, the total is exactly 2, which meets the bid. So I should go with 2 7s as the opening bid.\n"
