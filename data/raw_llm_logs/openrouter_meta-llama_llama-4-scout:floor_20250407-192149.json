Since I have a few 1s in my hand (1, 5, 6, 7, 0, 9, 9, 6), but not enough to confidently make a higher bid on 1s without knowing Player 0's hand, I should consider bidding on a digit that I have multiple of or challenging if I think the bid is unlikely. My hand contains 3 '9's and 2 '6's, among other digits. Given that I have 2 sixes and 3 nines, bidding on '3 6s' or '4 9s' could be strategic, but I must ensure it's higher than the current bid of '2 1s'. Bidding '3 6s' seems reasonable as it's higher in quantity than '2 1s' and involves digits I have.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 6s\"\n}\n```",
