        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 1s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "\nAlright, let's break down the situation. I have the hand 01795063, which gives me two 0s, one 1, and the rest are unique digits. The current bid is 2 1s from Player 1. I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge.\n\nFirst, considering the bid history: Player 0 started with 2 0s, and Player 1 responded with 2 1s. Since the current bid is 2 1s, my next move must be a higher bid. A higher bid can be either a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 0s. If I bid 3 0s, it's a higher quantity than the current 2 1s. However, I need to consider the likelihood of the total count across both hands. Since I have two 0s, the other player might have some 0s as well. If they have one or two, the total could be 3 or 4. Bidding 3 0s seems plausible but risky if the other player doesn't have any.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 2s, which is a higher digit than 1 but keeps the quantity the same. Since I don't have any 2s in my hand, this might be a bluff. But considering the current bid is 2 1s, moving to 2 2s is a valid higher bid and might be less obvious.\n\nAnother option is to challenge. If I think the current bid of 2 1s is too high, I can challenge. But since I have one 1 in my hand, and the other player might have one as well, the total could be two. It's possible, so challenging might not be the best move unless I'm certain the total is less than two.\n\nGiven that, I think making a higher bid is safer. Between 3 0s and 2 2s, I prefer 2 2s because it's a straightforward higher digit without increasing the quantity, which might be more believable since I have two 0s to support a lower quantity bid. This also keeps the pressure on the opponent to either go higher or challenge.\n\nSo, I'll go with 2 2s as my bid. It's a valid higher bid, and it doesn't commit me to a higher quantity, which could be risky if the other player doesn't have additional 0s.\n"
