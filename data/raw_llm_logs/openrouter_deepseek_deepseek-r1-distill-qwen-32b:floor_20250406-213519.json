You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nFirst, I have the hand: 02893695. Let me break that down. The digits I have are 0, 2, 8, 9, 3, 6, 9, and 5. Looking at these, I notice that I have two 9s. That's interesting because having duplicates might be useful when making a bid.\n\nThe game state says it's my turn, and the current bid is None, meaning no one has bid yet. So, I'm the first to make a bid. Since there's no previous bid, I can start with any quantity and digit, but I have to make sure it's a valid bid.\n\nIn Liar's Poker, each bid must be strictly higher than the previous one. Since this is the first bid, I can choose any quantity and digit. However, I should consider what's likely to be a good starting point. If I bid too high, the opponent might challenge it, and if I'm wrong, I lose. But if I bid too low, it might be easy for the opponent to outbid me, leading me into a trap.\n\nI have two 9s in my hand. Since each player has 8 digits, the maximum possible for any digit is 16 (8 from each player). If I bid 3 9s, that's a reasonable starting point. I know I have two, so the opponent would need to have at least one 9 for the total to be three. It's a moderate bid that's not too high but also not too low.\n\nWhy choose 9s? Well, 9 is a high digit, which could be advantageous because if someone wants to outbid, they can either increase the quantity or choose a higher digit. Since 9 is already high, the only way to outbid is by increasing the quantity, which might be riskier for the opponent.\n\nAlso, considering the other digits in my hand, I don't have any other duplicates except for the two 9s. So, it's logical to base my bid on the digit I have the most of.\n\nAnother consideration is that starting with a bid gives me control over the game's flow. If I make a bid that's not too aggressive, the opponent might feel compelled to either challenge or make a slightly higher bid. If they challenge, I can win if the total is at least 3. If they make a higher bid, I can decide whether to challenge or make an even higher bid based on their move.\n\nI should also think about what the opponent might have. Since I don't have any information about their hand, I have to make a bid that's plausible but also leaves room for uncertainty. Bidding 3 9s is a good balance because it's a specific number that's neither too high nor too low, making it a reasonable starting point.\n\nIn conclusion, I'll start by bidding 3 9s. This uses the duplicates I have, sets a moderate challenge for the opponent, and gives me a good position to respond to their next move.\n"
