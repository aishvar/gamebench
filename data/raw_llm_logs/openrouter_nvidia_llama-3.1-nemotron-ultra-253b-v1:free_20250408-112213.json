You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

My hand is 12511875. Let me look at my digits first.\n\nMy hand has the digits: 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 8, 7, 5. Let me count how many of each I have. \n\n1 appears three times, 2 once, 5 twice, 7 once, 8 once. So, the counts are: 1:3, 2:1, 5:2, 7:1, 8:1. The other digits (0,3,4,6,9) are zero in my hand.\n\nSince the opponent also has 8 digits, the total possible for any digit is up to 3 (mine) + whatever they have. But since I don't know their hand, I have to make a safe bid.\n\nThe first bid has to be a minimum of 1, but I need to start with something that's likely true but not too high. Let's think: for the digit 1, I have three. If the opponent has none, total is 3. If they have one, it's 4. So maybe starting with 3 1s? But wait, the bid must be strictly higher than the current bid, which is None. So the first bid can be any valid one. But maybe I can go higher.\n\nAlternatively, maybe bid a digit that I have a couple of, but not the highest. Let's see. For example, 2: I have one. If I bid 2 2s, but that's risky because the opponent might not have any. Then total would be 1, which is less than 2. If I get challenged, I lose.\n\nAlternatively, maybe bid a digit that's common. Since 1 is the most common in my hand, maybe start with 3 1s. But wait, I have three 1s. The opponent might have some. So total could be 3 or more. If I bid 3 1s, that's safe. But maybe I can go higher. Wait, but the opponent could challenge if they have none. So maybe start with 4 1s? That's a bit risky. If they have one 1, total is 4, which is okay. But if they have none, then total is 3, so the bid would fail. So maybe 4 1s is a possible bluff. But since it's the first bid, maybe it's better to play safe.\n\nAlternatively, look for a digit that I have some of, and maybe the opponent might have some. For example, 5: I have two. If I bid 3 5s, assuming the opponent has one. But if they have none, total is 2, which is less than 3, so that's a bad bid. So maybe not.\n\nWhat about 8? I have one. If I bid 2 8s, but that's risky. Opponent might have none. So total is 1, which is less than 2. So that's not safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 7. I have one. Bidding 2 7s. Same problem.\n\nSo maybe the safest is to bid 3 1s. Because I have three, and even if the opponent has none, the total is 3, which meets the bid. Wait, the bid is \"at least\" the quantity. So if I bid 3 1s, and the total is exactly 3, then that's okay. So if I start with 3 1s, that's a valid bid. But since the opponent knows that I have three 1s (they don't, but they might suspect), but they don't know my hand. Wait, in Liar's Poker, the hands are secret. So the opponent doesn't know my digits. So if I bid 3 1s, they have to decide whether to challenge or bid higher. But since the total could be exactly 3, if I have three and they have none, then the bid is valid. So starting with 3 1s is safe. But maybe I can make a higher bid. Wait, the rules say the first bid can be any valid one. But to maximize the chance of winning, maybe start with a lower bid. But the goal is to make the opponent doubt. Alternatively, maybe bid higher to put pressure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 4 of a digit that I have some, but not too many. For example, 4 1s. If I have three, and the opponent has one, total is 4. But if they have none, then it's 3, which is less than 4, so the challenge would make me lose. So that's risky. But maybe the opponent would not challenge immediately. Since it's the first bid, maybe they will bid higher. But since the opponent is Player 1, which is another AI, maybe they will think through.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a digit that's not my strongest, but could have a higher total. For example, 2: I have one. If the opponent has two, total is three. But I don't know. So that's uncertain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe look for a digit that's more common in general. Like 1, 0, or 5. But 0: I have none. So if I bid 0s, that's risky. For example, if I bid 2 0s, but I have none, opponent might have two. But I don't know.\n\nHmm. So given that my strongest digit is 1 with three, maybe start with 3 1s. That's safe because even if the opponent has none, the total is 3. So the bid is valid. So the action would be BID: 3 1s. But wait, the example in the problem shows that when the user has two 6s, they bid 4 6s. But in that case, maybe they were trying to bluff. But in my case, if I have three 1s, bidding 3 1s is the minimum. But maybe I can go higher. Wait, the rules say that the bid must be strictly higher than the current bid. Since the current bid is None, any valid bid is allowed. So the first bid can be anything. But the strategy here is to make a bid that is likely true but also puts pressure on the opponent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 4 1s. If I have three, and the opponent has at least one, then total is 4 or more. But if they have none, then it's 3. So if I bid 4 1s, there's a risk. But maybe the opponent will think that I have three and they have one, so they might not challenge. But since it's the first move, maybe they will challenge. If they challenge, and the total is 3, then I lose. So maybe that's too risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe bid a higher digit. For example, 3 8s. I have one 8. If the opponent has two, total is three. But if they have none, then total is one. So that's a bad bid. So that's not safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 3 5s. I have two. If the opponent has one, total is three. So that's possible. But again, risky.\n\nSo the safest first bid is 3 1s. Because I know I have three, so the minimum total is three. So the bid is valid. Then the opponent has to decide whether to challenge or bid higher. Since they don't know my hand, they might not challenge. So that's a good starting point.\n\nSo the reasoning is: I have three 1s in my hand. Starting with a bid of 3 1s is safe because even if the opponent has none, the total is exactly 3, which meets the bid. This puts the opponent in a position where they have to either bid higher or challenge, but challenging would risk them losing if they have any 1s. So this is a solid opening move.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have three 1s in my hand. Starting with a bid of 3 1s is safe because the minimum total is 3 (if the opponent has none), which meets the bid. This pressures the opponent to either raise or challenge, but challenging risks their loss if they have any 1s.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 1s\"\n}",
