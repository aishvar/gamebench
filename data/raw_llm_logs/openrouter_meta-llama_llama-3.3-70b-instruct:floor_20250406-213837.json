        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 8s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Considering the bid history, Player 1 raised the bid from 2 2s to 3 8s, indicating they might have a strong hand or are trying to bluff. Given that I only have one 8, bidding a higher quantity of 8s would be risky without more information. However, I can try to increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, as this is considered a higher bid. The next higher digit after 8 is 9, but since I don't have any 9s in my hand, this could also be risky. Another option is to challenge the bid if I think it's unlikely, but without knowing Player 1's hand, this is also a gamble. Given my hand and the current bid, a safer approach might be to bid on a digit I have more information about or challenge if the bid seems too high. Since the current bid is 3 8s and I only have one 8, I should consider if having at least three 8s in total is plausible. If I had two or more 8s, I might consider bidding higher on 8s, but with only one, the risk is high. Challenging seems like a viable option because if Player 1 is bluffing or doesn't have enough 8s to meet the bid, I could win. However, this decision heavily depends on the likelihood of Player 1's bid being true, which is hard to assess without more information. Given the uncertainty and my hand, a more strategic move would be to challenge the current bid, hoping that Player 1 doesn't have enough 8s to fulfill it.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
