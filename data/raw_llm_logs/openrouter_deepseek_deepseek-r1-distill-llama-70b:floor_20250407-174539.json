                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn. The current bid is None, which means I get to make the first bid. My hand is 82195004. Let me think about what digits I have here.\n\nBreaking it down, the digits in my hand are 8, 2, 1, 9, 5, 0, 0, 4. So, I have two zeros. That's interesting. I remember that in Liar's Poker, each player has 8 digits, so together there are 16 digits in total. Since I have two zeros, the opponent could have anywhere from 0 to 4 zeros, but wait, no, the maximum any digit can have is 16, but since there are only two players, the maximum for any digit is 8 each. But actually, each digit can only appear up to 8 times across both players because each player has 8 digits. So, the total number of any digit, say 0, can be between 0 and 8 for each player, but combined, it's between 0 and 16. But since I have two zeros, the opponent can have 0 to 6 zeros. Hmm, but I think the maximum possible for any digit is 16, but that's across both players. Wait, no, each player can have up to 8 of the same digit, but in reality, it's unlikely because the digits are distributed across 0-9.\n\nWait, no, each player has 8 unique digits? No, each player has 8 digits, which can repeat. So, for example, a player could have all 8 digits as 0, but that's probably rare. So, in my hand, I have two zeros. So, the total number of zeros in both hands could be between 2 (if the opponent has 0) and 10 (if the opponent has 8 zeros). But wait, no, because each player has 8 digits, so the maximum any digit can have in total is 16, but that's if both players have 8 of the same digit, which is impossible because each player can only have up to 8. Wait, no, each player can have up to 8 of the same digit, so the maximum total for a digit is 16. But in reality, it's unlikely.\n\nSo, since I have two zeros, the total number of zeros in both hands could be between 2 and 10. Because the opponent could have 0 to 8 zeros, but since I have 2, the total would be 2 + opponent's zeros, which can be 0-8, so 2-10.\n\nBut I'm the first to bid, so I need to choose a digit and a quantity. The goal is to bid in such a way that I can either make a higher bid later or challenge if I think the opponent is lying.\n\nSince I have two zeros, maybe I can bid on zeros. Let's see, if I bid 2 zeros, that's safe because I have two. But maybe I can bid higher. Wait, the current bid is None, so I can choose any digit and any quantity. But I should choose a digit I have some of, so I can control the bid.\n\nWait, but I can also bid on a digit I don't have, but that's riskier because I don't know how many the opponent has. So, maybe it's safer to bid on a digit I have.\n\nLooking at my digits: 8,2,1,9,5,0,0,4. So, digits present are 0,1,2,4,5,8,9. I don't have 3,6,7.\n\nSo, I could bid on 0,1,2,4,5,8, or 9.\n\nI have two zeros, one each of the others. So, if I bid on 0 with a quantity of 2, that's safe. But maybe I can bid higher, like 3 or 4, but I'm not sure if the opponent has that many.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a digit I don't have, but that's more risky.\n\nWait, but if I bid on a digit I don't have, say 3, and bid 0, that's possible, but I don't know. But since I don't have any 3s, the opponent could have 0-8, but the total could be 0-8. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, I can bid on 0 for 2, which is safe. But maybe I can bid higher, like 4, hoping that the opponent has 2 as well. But that's a risk because if the opponent has only 1 or 0, then the total would be 2 or 3, which is less than 4, and I'd lose if challenged.\n\nAlternatively, I can bid on 1, which I have one of. If I bid 1 on 1, that's safe, but maybe I can bid higher.\n\nWait, but the initial bid can be any quantity and any digit. So, perhaps I can choose a digit that's less likely to have a high count. For example, 9: I have one 9. So, if I bid 1 on 9, that's safe. Or maybe 2 on 9, hoping the opponent has one as well.\n\nBut I think the safest bid is to bid on a digit I have and a quantity I can control. So, since I have two zeros, I can bid 2 on 0. That's a safe bid because I know there are at least two zeros. If the opponent challenges, I can reveal and win because the total is at least two. If they don't challenge, they have to bid higher, either in quantity or digit.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid higher, like 3 on 0, but that's risky because the opponent might have only one or none, making the total 2 or 3. If I bid 3 and the total is 2, then I lose. So, better to bid 2 on 0.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on another digit. For example, I have one 8. If I bid 1 on 8, that's safe. But the opponent might have more, so if I bid 1, and the opponent has 2, the total is 3, which is higher than my bid, so if they challenge, I lose. So, it's safer to bid on the digit I have more of.\n\nSo, zeros are the best bet. I have two, so I can bid 2 on 0. That's a solid move. It's unlikely the opponent has more than 6 zeros, but even if they have 6, the total would be 8, which is higher than 2, but I'm not challenging, just bidding. So, the opponent can either challenge my bid of 2 on 0 or bid higher.\n\nIf the opponent challenges, I can show my two zeros, and since the total is at least two, I win. If they don't challenge, they have to bid higher, maybe 3 on 0 or move to a higher digit.\n\nSo, I think the best move is to bid 2 on 0.\n"
