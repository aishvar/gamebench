You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move in this Liar's Poker game. Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, I look at my hand: 7, 8, 4, 2, 5, 1, 5, 6. So that's eight digits. I need to analyze which digits I have and how they might influence the bidding.\n\nThe current bid is 'None', which means it's the first move. Since there are no previous bids, I can start with any quantity and digit, but I have to make sure it's a valid bid. Remember, the bid must be strictly higher than the current bid, but since it's the first, I can set any starting point.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 5s. That's a decent count. Maybe I can use that as a base for my bid. If I bid 3 5s, I'm assuming that there are at least three 5s in total across both players. Since I have two, the other player would need at least one more. That seems plausible because the other player's hand is unknown, but it's possible they have a 5.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider other digits. For example, I have a 7, 8, 4, 2, 1, 6, and two 5s. Are there any digits that appear more frequently? Let's see: 5 appears twice, others once. So 5 is the most frequent in my hand.\n\nIf I bid on 5s, I can set the quantity higher than what I have, hoping the other player has at least one more. Bidding 3 5s is a good starting point because it's a moderate bid, not too high that it's obviously wrong, but also not too low that someone can easily outbid it.\n\nI should also consider the maximum possible quantity. Since there are 16 digits in total (8 each), the maximum for any digit is 16. Bidding 3 5s is well within that range and leaves room for the other player to have some 5s.\n\nAnother consideration is whether to challenge, but since it's the first bid, I can't challenge. So I have to make a bid. Starting with 3 5s seems reasonable because it's based on my hand and gives a moderate expectation for the total count.\n\nI don't think I have any digits that would allow me to make a higher bid without risking it being too high. For example, if I bid 4 5s, that would require the other player to have two more 5s, which might be less likely. So 3 5s is a safer starting point.\n\nIn summary, I'll make the first bid of 3 5s, using the two I have and assuming the other player has at least one more.\n"
