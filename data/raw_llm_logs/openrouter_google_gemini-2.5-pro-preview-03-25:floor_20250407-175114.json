For this bid to be true, there must be at least five 7s across both hands (16 digits total). Since I have two 7s, Player 1 must have at least three 7s in their 8-digit hand. Player 1 has consistently bid on 7s (3 7s, 4 7s, 5 7s), suggesting they likely hold some 7s. However, needing three 7s from their hand alone is statistically unlikely (the average number of any digit in an 8-card hand is 0.8). While their bidding increases the perceived likelihood, 5 is a relatively high quantity out of 16 total digits (expected value is 1.6). Bidding higher, such as 5 8s, is also risky. I only have two 8s, meaning Player 1 would need three 8s, and they have shown no interest in 8s. Challenging seems like the safer and more statistically sound move, betting against the relatively low probability that Player 1 holds three or more 7s.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\n```",
