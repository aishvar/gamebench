For that bid to be valid, the opponent would need to have at least 2 '1's. While possible, that's a relatively aggressive jump from my initial 2 9s bid, especially since my opponent didn't raise on 9s, suggesting they may not have many 9s but instead more 1s. Still, it's plausible they have 2 or more '1's. Since I only have 1, and it's risky to challenge now, a safer strategic play is to increase the bid conservatively. I have two 9s, so bidding 3 9s is a valid higher bid (same quantity, higher digit). This continues the game and puts pressure back on the opponent.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 9s\"\n}",
