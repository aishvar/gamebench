For the total count to be 9 twos, Player 0 would need to hold at least 8 twos in their hand. Given that each hand is 8 digits, this would mean Player 0's entire hand is almost all twos, which is highly improbable. The expected average count of any digit across both hands is around 3.2 (16 digits / 10 digits). A count of 9 is significantly above this average, making the bid very unlikely to be valid. Therefore, the optimal move is to challenge the bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
