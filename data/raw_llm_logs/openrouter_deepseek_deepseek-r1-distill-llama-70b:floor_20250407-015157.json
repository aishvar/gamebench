You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let's see, the game state says it's my turn, and the current bid is None. That means I get to make the first bid. My hand is 16640587. Hmm, let me break that down. Each digit is: 1, 6, 6, 4, 0, 5, 8, 7. So, I have two 6s, and one each of 1, 4, 0, 5, 8, 7. \n\nSince the current bid is None, I can choose any digit and any quantity, as long as it's a valid bid. But I want to make a smart move. I should think about what digits are likely to have a higher count. I have two 6s, so maybe I can bid on 6s. But how high should I go? If I bid 2 6s, that's safe because I have exactly two, but maybe I can go higher. However, I don't know what the other player has. If I bid 3 6s, and the other player has at least one 6, then the total would be 3 or more, and I'd win. But if the other player has none, then I lose.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a digit I have only one of, but that might not be as strong. Let me think about the possible digits. 0 is a possible digit, but I have only one. Same with 1, 4, 5, 7, 8. So, 6 is my strongest because I have two. \n\nWait, but the maximum quantity is 16, but since there are only 8 digits per player, the maximum possible for any digit is 16 (if both players have 8 of the same digit, which is impossible). So, the maximum realistic is 16, but that's only for 0s if both players have all 0s. But in reality, it's much lower.\n\nSince I'm the first to bid, I should probably start with a low but reasonable bid to not overcommit. Bidding 2 6s seems safe because I have two, and the opponent might have none, one, or more. But if I bid 2 6s, the opponent might challenge me, thinking that maybe there's only one or none. Or they might bid higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can bid 3 6s, hoping that the opponent has at least one. But if they have none, I lose. So, 2 6s is safer. Or maybe I should pick another digit. Let me see, 8 is a high digit, but I have only one. If I bid 1 8s, that's very safe, but maybe too low. The opponent might just bid higher on 8s or another digit.\n\nWait, but the bidding has to be strictly higher. So, if I bid 2 6s, the opponent can bid 2 7s, 2 8s, etc., or 3 of any digit. So, maybe I should consider a digit that's less likely to be bid higher. 6 is a middle digit. Maybe 5s or 4s are less likely to be bid higher. But I have only one of those.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 1 of a high digit like 8 or 7, but that might not be as strong. Hmm. \n\nWait, another thought: since I have two 6s, and the opponent could have up to 8 digits, maybe I can bid 3 6s. If the opponent has at least one, I win. If not, I lose. But it's a 50-50 chance. Maybe I should go for 3 6s. \n\nBut since it's the first bid, maybe it's better to start low. Let me think about what's more strategic. Starting with a lower bid gives me more flexibility. If I bid 2 6s, and the opponent challenges, I win because there are at least two. If they don't challenge, they might bid higher, but I can decide whether to challenge or bid again.\n\nAlternatively, if I bid 3 6s and the opponent has none, I lose. But if they have one or two, I win. Since I don't know their hand, it's a gamble. \n\nI think I'll play it safe and bid 2 6s. That way, I'm certain to have at least that many, and the opponent might not want to challenge immediately. Plus, it's a good starting point.\n"
