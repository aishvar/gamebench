You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to make the first bid in this game of Liar's Poker. My hand is 63601449. Let me count how many of each digit I have. \n\nLooking at my digits: 6, 3, 6, 0, 1, 4, 4, 9. So breaking it down:\n\n- 0: 1\n- 1: 1\n- 3: 1\n- 4: 2\n- 6: 2\n- 9: 1\n\nSo the digits I have the most of are 4 and 6, each with two. Since the current bid is None, I can start with any valid bid. The first bid has to be at least 1 of any digit. But I want to make a bid that's reasonable based on my hand but also not too easy to challenge. \n\nSince I have two 6s and two 4s, maybe I can start with a bid that's higher in quantity. For example, if I bid 2 6s, that's based on my own hand. But since there are two players, each with 8 digits, the total possible digits are 16. The opponent could have more 6s. But since I have two, maybe the total is at least two. But the first bid needs to be a quantity and digit. \n\nWait, the rules say the bid must be strictly higher than the current bid, but since the current bid is None, the first player can bid any valid combination. So I can start with the lowest possible, like 1 of any digit. But to set a higher bar, maybe start with a higher quantity. \n\nBut since I have two 6s, maybe bid 2 6s. That's a safe starting point because even if the opponent has none, the total is 2, which meets the bid. But maybe I can go higher. Alternatively, since 4s are also two in my hand, maybe bid 2 4s. But which digit is better? \n\nAlternatively, since 6 is a higher digit than 4, maybe bid 2 6s. But the first bid can be any, so maybe start with a lower quantity but higher digit. Wait, no, the first bid can be any, but the next bid has to be higher in quantity or same quantity and higher digit. \n\nWait, the first bid is None, so the first player can bid any quantity and digit. So the best strategy is to start with a bid that's based on your own hand but also considering that the opponent might have some. For example, if I have two 6s, maybe bid 3 6s. That way, the opponent needs to have at least one 6 for the bid to be valid. But if they have none, then the total is 2, which is less than 3, so they might challenge. But since it's the first bid, maybe starting with a lower quantity is safer. \n\nAlternatively, since the maximum possible is 16, but that's unlikely. Let's think: if I bid 2 6s, the opponent can either bid higher quantity or same quantity with a higher digit. If I bid 2 6s, they might bid 2 7s, 2 8s, etc., or 3 of any digit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher digit. For example, 1 9s. Since I have one 9, the opponent might have another, making the total 2. But that's a low quantity. \n\nAlternatively, since I have two 4s and two 6s, maybe bid 3 4s. That would require the opponent to have at least one 4. If they have one, total is 3, which meets the bid. If they have none, then it's 2, which is less. But since it's the first bid, maybe that's a bit risky. \n\nAlternatively, start with a lower quantity but higher digit. For example, 1 9s. But that's a low bid. \n\nHmm. The key is to make a bid that's plausible based on my hand but not too easy to challenge. Since I have two 6s, maybe bid 2 6s. That's a safe starting bid. The opponent has 8 digits, so there's a chance they have at least one 6, making the total 3. But even if they don't, the bid is 2, which I have. Wait, no: the bid is the total across all players. If I have 2, and the opponent has 0, the total is 2. So if I bid 2 6s, and the total is 2, then if someone challenges, I win. Because the count is exactly 2. So that's safe. \n\nWait, but the bid is \"at least\" the quantity. So if I bid 2 6s, and the total is 2, then it's valid. So even if the opponent has none, my bid is correct. Because I have 2, so the total is 2. So bidding 2 6s is a safe first bid. Because the total is exactly 2, which meets the bid. \n\nSo that's a good move. Alternatively, I could bid higher, like 3 6s, but that would require the opponent to have at least one 6. If they don't, the total is 2, which is less than 3, so if they challenge, I lose. But since it's the first bid, maybe starting with a safe bid is better. \n\nTherefore, the best initial bid is 2 6s, since I have two, ensuring that even if the opponent has none, the total is 2, which meets the bid. That way, if the opponent challenges, I win. So that's a safe opening move."
