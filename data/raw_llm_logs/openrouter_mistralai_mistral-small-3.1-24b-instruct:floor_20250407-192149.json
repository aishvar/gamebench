Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, and the opponent has bid '2 6s', it is plausible that they have at least one '6' in their hand. However, challenging at this point is risky because the opponent could potentially have more '6s'. Instead, I will make a bid that is slightly higher but still reasonable. Bidding 'Q D' (Queen of Diamonds, which translates to '3 7s') is a strategic move because it increases the digit and the quantity modestly, making it harder for the opponent to challenge without risking a loss.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: Q D\"\n}\n```",
