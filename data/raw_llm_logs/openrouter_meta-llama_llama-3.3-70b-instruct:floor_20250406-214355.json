        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 7s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Since my goal is to make a valid higher bid or challenge, and considering I have no 7s, bidding on a higher digit with a reasonable quantity seems like a safer option than challenging without any 7s to back my challenge. I could bid on the 5s since I have two of them, but I need to bid higher than '3 7s'. Bidding the same quantity with a higher digit is an option, but since I don't have any digits higher than 7 in sufficient quantities, I must consider increasing the quantity. Given that I have two 5s and the bid history shows an escalation, I could consider bidding on a digit I have in abundance, but I must ensure it's a higher bid. Since I don't have enough information about Player 0's hand and given the rules, a safe increase would be to bid on a digit that is at least as high as 7 or higher if I had enough of it, but since I don't have any 7s or higher digits in sufficient quantities, my best bet is to consider the next best option which is to challenge the bid if it seems unlikely or find a digit that allows me to increase the quantity. However, without sufficient higher digits, challenging seems risky without more information. Given these constraints, my best option, considering I want to make a move that is likely to be valid and doesn't overextend, is to carefully consider what I can bid on. Since I have two 5s and the current bid is '3 7s', and I need to bid higher, I could consider '3 8s' or higher, but I have no 8s. Thus, my safest option, considering the need to bid higher and the lack of high digits, is actually to challenge the current bid because I don't have the digits to safely increase the bid to a higher quantity or digit that I can confidently back. The bid of '3 7s' might be plausible given the total number of digits in play is 16, but without having any 7s, I'm in a position where challenging might be my best option to not overcommit.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
