        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '9 0s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

The maximum quantity is 16, so I can bid up to 16. My hand is 92665084, which contains two 0s. I can count the number of 0s in my hand and potentially in the other player's hand based on the bid history. Since the last bid was 9 0s, and considering that my hand has 2 0s, it's possible the other player has a significant number of 0s. However, bidding 10 0s is the next logical step if I think there are more than 9 0s in total. I have to decide whether to challenge or make a new bid. Given that I have 2 0s, it's plausible that the total count of 0s could be 9 or more if the other player has at least 7 0s. However, the bid history doesn't strongly suggest that. I will analyze my hand for higher digits. I have one 9, no 8s, one 7, two 6s, three other digits. The current bid is on 0s, so I can either bid on a higher digit with the same quantity or more. Bidding 9 1s is a possibility since it's a higher digit than 0. I'll choose to bid 9 1s as it's a valid higher bid.\", \"action\": \"BID: 9 1s\"}",
