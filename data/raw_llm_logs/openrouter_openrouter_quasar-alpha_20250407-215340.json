The probability that my opponent holds at least 3 twos in their 8 digits is low, as the expected number of 2s in 8 random digits is less than 1. Bidding higher on 2s would be risky without any in my hand. Making a higher bid on another digit is safer if I have a strong count. I have two zeros in my hand, so bidding 3 zeros is plausible, matching the quantity but with a higher digit, which is a valid raise. Alternatively, I could bid 4 of some digit. Since I have two 7s and two 0s, but no other strong counts, bidding 4 of any digit would be speculative. Therefore, the best move is to bid 3 zeros, a valid higher bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 0s\"\n}",
