                    "refusal": null,
                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out whether to bid higher than 2 8s or challenge. My hand is 64974278. Let me count the digits I have. \n\nLooking at my hand: 6,4,9,7,4,2,7,8. So, I have two 7s, one 8, two 4s, and the others are single digits. The current bid is 2 8s from Player 1. Since I have one 8, there could be more in Player 1's hand. But the previous bid was 2 7s by me, then Player 1 upped it to 2 8s. \n\nTo make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or keep the same quantity but use a higher digit. The current bid is 2 8s. The next possible bid could be 3 of any digit (since 3 is higher than 2), or 2 of a digit higher than 8. But the highest digit is 9, so 2 9s would be higher than 2 8s. \n\nIn my hand, I have one 9. If I bid 2 9s, that would be a valid higher bid. But is that a good move? Player 1 has 8 digits too. If Player 1 has at least one 9, then the total would be at least two 9s (my one plus their one). But if they have none, then total is just my one. So bidding 2 9s is risky. Alternatively, increasing the quantity to 3. Let's say I bid 3 of a digit. Which digit? Let's see which digits I have more of. I have two 7s and two 4s. Maybe bid 3 4s? But the previous bid was 2 8s. So 3 4s is higher in quantity. That's allowed. If I bid 3 4s, that's a valid bid. But do I think there are three 4s in total? I have two. If Player 1 has at least one more 4, then it's possible. Otherwise, it's a bluff. Alternatively, I could bid 3 of a higher digit, like 3 7s. I have two 7s; maybe Player 1 has another one. But 3 7s would be a higher quantity than 2 8s. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the current bid is 2 8s, maybe I can challenge. Let's see. If the total 8s are exactly 2, then I have one, so Player 1 has one. But maybe they have more. If they have two 8s, total would be three. So challenging would lose. But if they only have one, then total is two, which meets the bid. Wait, the bid is 2 8s. So if the total is exactly 2, the bid is valid. If I challenge and the total is 2, I lose. So unless I think the total is less than 2, which is impossible because I have one and the bid is 2, meaning Player 1 must have at least one. So the total is at least two (my one plus their at least one). Wait, no: wait, the current bid is 2 8s. The previous bid was 2 7s by me. Then Player 1 bid 2 8s. So they could have one 8, making total two (my one plus their one). Or they could have more. So challenging now would be risky because if the total is exactly two, the bid is valid. So challenging would make me lose. Therefore, challenging is not safe.\n\nSo I need to bid. Let's think about options. Bidding 3 4s: my two plus possible one from them. Or 3 7s: my two plus one. Alternatively, 2 9s. Let's evaluate which is better. If I bid 2 9s, that's higher in digit (9 >8) with same quantity. But I have one 9. If they have at least one, then total is two, which meets the bid. But if they have none, then total is one, which would make the bid invalid. So if I bid 2 9s, it's a bluff. Alternatively, maybe 3 4s. If I have two, and they have one, total is three. But if they don't have any, it's two. So that's a risk. Alternatively, maybe 3 7s. I have two, maybe they have one or two. Let's think about the previous bids. I had bid 2 7s. Then Player 1 bid 2 8s. So maybe they don't have 7s, which is why they upped the digit. Or maybe they do. But if I bid 3 7s, they might challenge if they have none, making total two (my two). So that's a bad move. Alternatively, bidding 3 0s. But I have none. Wait, but the digits can be 0-9. My hand has no 0s, so maybe 3 0s is a possible bluff. But that's risky because if they have none, total is zero. So that's not good. \n\nAlternatively, 3 8s. The current bid is 2 8s. So 3 8s is higher in quantity. I have one 8. If they have two 8s, total is three. If they have one, total is two. But if I bid 3 8s, then if they have two, it's valid. If they have one, then total is two, so my bid of 3 would be invalid. But they might challenge. So maybe that's a risky move. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid a higher digit with same quantity. The current bid is 2 8s. The next higher digit is 9. So 2 9s. As before. \n\nSo between 2 9s and 3 4s. Let's see which is more plausible. If I bid 2 9s, I need at least one 9 from the opponent. If they have one, it's valid. If not, it's a bluff. If I bid 3 4s, I need them to have at least one 4. Since I have two, if they have one, total is three. If they have none, it's two. So both options are bluffs, but which is more likely? \n\nAlternatively, maybe 3 5s. I have no 5s. So that's a total bluff. But if they have three 5s, which is possible, but I don't know. \n\nAlternatively, 3 6s. I have one 6. They could have two. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's think about the opponent's possible hand. Since the previous bid was 2 7s by me, and they bid 2 8s. Maybe they have some 8s. If they have two 8s, then total 8s would be three (my one plus their two). But their bid was 2 8s. They might have one or two. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they have a lot of 8s and are trying to push the bid higher. \n\nBut regardless, challenging now is risky because even if they have one 8, total is two, which is valid. So challenging is not a good idea. \n\nSo I have to bid. Let's consider possible bids:\n\nOption 1: 2 9s. This is a higher digit than 8. If they have at least one 9, it's valid. But if they have none, it's a bluff. \n\nOption 2: 3 4s. Higher quantity. I have two, they might have one. \n\nOption 3: 3 7s. I have two, they might have one. \n\nOption 4: 3 8s. If they have two, total is three. \n\nWhich is the safest? \n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 7s. The previous bid was 2 7s by me. Then the opponent bid 2 8s. Maybe they don't have 7s, so they changed the digit. So if I bid 3 7s, and they have none, the total is two, which would make my bid invalid. But if they have one, then total is three. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 2 9s, and they have none, total is one. But if they have one, it's two. \n\nSo both options are risky. \n\nAlternatively, 3 0s. But I have none. If they have three 0s, but that's possible. But maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, 3 6s. I have one. They might have two. \n\nHmm. Another angle: since the current bid is 2 8s, and the previous was 2 7s, maybe the opponent is trying to push the digit higher. They might have a few 8s. So if I bid 3 4s, which is a lower digit but higher quantity, maybe they can challenge. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best move is to bid 2 9s. It's a higher digit, same quantity. If they have at least one 9, it's valid. If not, it's a bluff, but they might challenge. But given that I have one 9, it's possible they have one. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the opponent bid 2 8s after my 2 7s, maybe they have a strong 8. If I bid 3 8s, perhaps they have two, making total three. But if they have one, total is two, which would make my bid invalid. \n\nThis is a tough call. Maybe the safest bid is 2 9s. It's a higher digit, and if they have one 9, then the total is two. I have one, so they need at least one. Alternatively, if they have none, it's a bluff. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should bid 3 4s. Since I have two, maybe they have one. But it's possible they don't. \n\nAlternatively, considering the opponent's previous move: they increased the digit from 7 to 8. Maybe they have more 8s than 7s. So if I bid 3 8s, perhaps they have two, making total three. But if they have one, then total is two. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent has two 8s, making total three. Then 3 8s would be a valid bid. But I can't know for sure. \n\nIn this situation, perhaps the best move is to bid 2 9s. It's a higher digit, and even if it's a bluff, the opponent might not challenge if they have a 9. Since I have one, it's plausible that they could have another. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent has more 8s. But challenging is not safe. \n\nSo I think the best move is to bid 2 9s.\n"
