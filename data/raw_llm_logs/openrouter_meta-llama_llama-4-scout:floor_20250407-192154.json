Given my hand is '98075306', I can count my digits to see if I can make a higher bid. I have one '6'. Since the current bid is '2 6s', to make a valid higher bid, I must either increase the quantity or the digit. I don't have enough '6's to increase the quantity (as I only have 1 '6'), so I need to bid on a higher digit. The highest digit I have is '9', '8', and there are no other '9's or '8's bid yet. However, I should check if bidding on a higher quantity of a lower digit or moving to a higher digit is strategic. Given that I only have one '6' and bidding higher on digit makes more sense than trying to out-quantity with what I have, I should consider if there's a strategic advantage in challenging or bidding higher on another digit.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 8s\"\n}\n```",
