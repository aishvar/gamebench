Since it's statistically unlikely to have 3 or more total ones across both hands (average count of any digit is about 1.6 in 16 digits), and given I only have one, the bid seems risky. Therefore, instead of increasing the bid, the best strategic move is to challenge, as it's probable that the total number of ones is less than 3.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
