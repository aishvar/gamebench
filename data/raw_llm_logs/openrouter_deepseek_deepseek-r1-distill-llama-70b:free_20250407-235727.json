You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation. \n\nFirst, I have the hand 25131064. Let me break that down. Each digit is a separate number, so my digits are 2, 5, 1, 3, 1, 0, 6, 4. So I have two 1s, and one each of 0,2,3,4,5,6. That's useful information because it tells me what digits I have and how many of each.\n\nSince it's the first bid, the current bid is None, which means I get to set the initial bid. My goal is to make a bid that's as strong as possible without being too risky. I don't want to overbid because if someone challenges me, I might lose. But I also want to set a bid that gives me a good foundation for future moves.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 1s. So I know that the total number of 1s in play is at least two. But since the other player has 8 digits as well, the maximum number of 1s could be up to 10 (if they have eight 1s, but that's highly unlikely). But realistically, it's probably not that high. \n\nSo, if I bid on 1s, I can safely say there are at least two. But maybe I can go higher. Let me think about the possible digits and their quantities. \n\nAlternatively, I could look at other digits I have and see if any of them have higher quantities. For example, I have one 0, one 2, etc. But since I only have one of each, bidding on those would be risky because if the other player doesn't have any, the total would be just one, and if I bid two, that would be a problem.\n\nWait, but I have two 1s. So maybe I can bid 2 1s. That seems safe because I know there are at least two. But maybe I can even go higher. Let's see. If I bid 3 1s, that would mean I think there are at least three 1s in total. Since I have two, the other player would need to have at least one. That's possible, but not certain. \n\nIs there a way to assess the likelihood? Well, without knowing the other player's hand, it's hard, but I can make an educated guess. Since I have two 1s, and the other player could have up to eight digits, the chance they have at least one 1 is decent, but not guaranteed. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a higher digit that I have only one of but might have a higher chance of the other player having more. For example, I have a 5. If I bid on 5s, I have one, so the total could be one or more. But that's a bit risky because if the other player has none, the bid would fail.\n\nWait, but the initial bid is None, so I can choose any digit and any quantity. Maybe I should pick a digit that's less likely to be in the other player's hand. Or perhaps pick a higher digit to set a higher bid. \n\nAlternatively, I could consider the distribution of digits. Since I have a 6, which is a higher digit, maybe I can bid on that. But I only have one, so if I bid 2 6s, and the other player doesn't have any, that would be a problem. \n\nHmm. So perhaps the safest bet is to bid on the digit I have the most of, which is 1s, with a quantity of 2. That way, I know for sure that the total is at least two, and it's a solid starting point. \n\nWait, but can I make a higher bid than that? Let's think. If I bid 2 1s, that's a valid starting bid. But maybe I can bid 3 1s, hoping the other player has at least one. If I do that, and the other player challenges, I might lose because maybe they don't have any. But if they don't challenge, I can continue bidding higher. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 2 1s, it's a safer bet because I know it's true, and then the other player might have to bid higher, which could put them in a tough spot. \n\nAnother angle: since I have a 0, which is a low digit, maybe I can bid on that. But I only have one 0, so again, it's risky. \n\nWait, but the other player might not expect me to bid on 0s because it's a low digit. So maybe that's a good strategy. If I bid 2 0s, and the other player doesn't have any, I lose. But if they do have at least one, I win. But I only have one, so it's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a higher digit that I have, like 6. Bidding 2 6s would require the other player to have at least one. But again, it's uncertain. \n\nI think the safest move is to bid on the digit I have the most of, which is 1s, with a quantity of 2. That way, I'm certain that the bid is valid, and it gives me a foundation to build on. \n\nSo, I'll go with BID: 2 1s. That seems like a solid starting point without being too risky.\n"
