For the bid to be true, Player 0 must have at least three 8s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, requiring 3 specific digits out of 8 for an opening bid seems somewhat unlikely, especially since I hold none of that digit. Challenging the bid seems like a strong option, as Player 0 bears the entire burden of possessing those three 8s. Making a higher bid, like '3 9s' (I have one 9) or '4 1s' (I have two 1s), is possible but less direct. Bidding '3 9s' requires Player 0 to have two 9s, which is plausible. Bidding '4 1s' requires Player 0 to have two 1s, also plausible, but escalates the quantity quickly. Given I have no 8s, challenging the claim of three 8s total feels like the most strategically sound move.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\n```",
