You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the current state. \n\nFirst, my hand is 61075304. Let me break that down: the digits I have are 6, 1, 0, 7, 5, 3, 0, 4. So I have two 0s, and one each of 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. That's eight digits in total, which makes sense because each player has eight secret digits.\n\nThe current bid is 2 7s, made by Player 1. The bid history shows that I started by bidding 2 0s, and then Player 1 upped it to 2 7s. Now it's my turn again. \n\nIn Liar's Poker, each bid has to be strictly higher than the previous one. That means I can either increase the quantity or, if I keep the quantity the same, choose a higher digit. Since the last bid was 2 7s, I can either bid a higher quantity with any digit, or the same quantity but a higher digit. But since 7 is the highest digit (after 9, but 7 is pretty high), the only way to go higher with the same quantity would be to choose a digit higher than 7, which is only 8 or 9. Alternatively, I can increase the quantity beyond 2.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have one 7. So if I were to bid on 7s, the total in both hands would have to be at least 3 for me to safely bid 3 7s. But I don't know how many 7s Player 1 has. They might have two, which would make the total 3, or they might have more. But since I only have one, I don't want to risk it unless I'm sure.\n\nAlternatively, I could look at other digits where I have more. For example, I have two 0s. The initial bid was 2 0s, but Player 1 went to 2 7s. If I want to bid on 0s again, I'd have to bid higher than 2, like 3 0s. But do I think there are at least three 0s in total? I have two, so Player 1 would need at least one. I don't know their hand, so it's a gamble.\n\nAnother approach is to consider challenging the bid. The current bid is 2 7s. If I challenge, we reveal the total number of 7s. If it's 2 or more, Player 1 wins; if it's less than 2, I win. I have one 7, so Player 1 must have at least one for the bid to hold. But maybe they have none, making the total 1, which would mean I win. But I don't know that for sure.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should consider making a bid on another digit where I have more confidence. Let's see, I have one 5 and one 6. If I bid on 5s or 6s, but the quantity would have to be higher than 2. But I only have one of each, so unless Player 1 has more, it's risky.\n\nWait, I also have a 3 and a 4. Not sure about those. Maybe I should consider the highest digit I can bid on with some certainty. Since I have two 0s, maybe I can bid 3 0s. But I'm not sure if Player 1 has at least one 0. If they don't, then the total would be 2, which is less than my bid of 3, and I'd lose.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a higher digit with the same quantity. Since 7 is high, the next higher digit is 8 or 9. If I bid 2 8s, that's higher than 2 7s. But do I have any 8s? No, I don't. So I don't know if there are any 8s in Player 1's hand. It's possible, but I have no information.\n\nSimilarly, bidding on 9s would be even riskier since I don't have any. So maybe challenging is better. If I challenge the 2 7s, and the total is less than 2, I win. But if it's 2 or more, I lose.\n\nConsidering all this, I think challenging might be the safer option. I only have one 7, so if Player 1 has at least one, the bid holds. But if they have none, then I win. Since I don't have any information about their hand, it's a 50-50 guess. Alternatively, I could try to bid on another digit where I have more, like 0s, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another thought: the initial bid was 2 0s by me, and then Player 1 bid 2 7s. Maybe they are trying to shift the focus to a higher digit. If I have two 0s, and I bid 2 0s, and then they bid 2 7s, perhaps they have at least one 7. So the total could be 2 or 3. If I challenge, and the total is exactly 2, I lose. If it's 1, I win. But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can bid on a digit I have more of. Wait, I have two 0s, but I already bid that. Maybe I can bid 3 0s, but I'm not sure if there are three in total. If Player 1 has one, then yes, but if not, then no.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. I'm leaning towards challenging because I don't have enough information to make a safe bid, and challenging might be the better option here. Plus, if I challenge and win, I gain the advantage. If I lose, then the game continues, but at least I tried.\n\nSo, I think I'll challenge the bid. Let's see what happens.\n"
