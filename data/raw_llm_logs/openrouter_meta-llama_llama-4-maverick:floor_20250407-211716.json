Assuming the opponent's hand is random, the expected number of 1s in their hand is 0.8 (since they have 8 digits and the probability of each being 1 is 0.1). The total expected number of 1s across both hands is 0.8 (since I have 0). The bid of 2 1s is higher than the expected total, but not extremely high. However, given that I have no 1s, it's plausible that the opponent has more than the expected number of 1s. To proceed, I can either challenge or bid higher. A reasonable next bid would be to bid on a different digit or increase the count. I have 2 sixes, so bidding on 6s could be a good strategy. The next bid should be higher than 2 1s, so I can bid '3 1s' or '2 6s'. Since '2 6s' is a valid bid and I have 2 sixes, it's a reasonable choice.\", \"action\": \"BID: 2 6s\"}",
