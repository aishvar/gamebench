        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 4s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let me try to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker situation. So, I have the hand 86033456. Let me break that down: the digits I have are 8, 6, 0, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6. So, I have two 6s, two 3s, and one each of 8, 0, 4, and 5. \n\nThe current bid is 3 4s from Player 1. I need to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid. \n\nFirst, I should assess the current bid. Player 1 is saying there are at least three 4s in total between both players. I have one 4 in my hand, so if Player 1 has two 4s, that would make three total. But if Player 1 has only one 4, then the total would be two, which would make the bid invalid. \n\nLooking at the bid history might help. The previous bids were: I bid 2 6s, then Player 1 bid 3 2s, I bid 3 3s, and now Player 1 bid 3 4s. So, each time the bid has increased either in quantity or digit. \n\nI know that I have two 6s, two 3s, and one 4. So, if I were to bid on 6s, I could go for 3 6s, which would be higher than the current 3 4s because 6 is higher than 4. Alternatively, I could try a higher quantity on a lower digit, but I think increasing the digit is safer.\n\nWait, but if I bid 3 6s, I have two in my hand. That means Player 1 would need to have at least one 6 for the total to be three. If they don't have any, then my bid would be invalid. But considering that I already bid 2 6s earlier, they might have at least one to make the total three. \n\nAlternatively, I could consider challenging the current bid. If I challenge 3 4s and the total is less than three, I win. But I have one 4, so Player 1 would need to have two. I don't know their hand, but maybe they don't have that many. \n\nHowever, challenging might be risky because if they do have two 4s, I lose. On the other hand, if I make a bid, I have some control over it. Since I have two 6s, bidding 3 6s seems plausible. Plus, 6 is a higher digit than 4, so it's a stronger bid. \n\nI think I'll go with bidding 3 6s. It's a reasonable move based on my hand, and it's a higher bid than the current one.\n"
