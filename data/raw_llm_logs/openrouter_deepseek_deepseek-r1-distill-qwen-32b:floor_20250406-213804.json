        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out what move to make in this Liar's Poker game. Let's see, I'm Player 0, and it's my turn. The current bid is None, which means I need to make the first bid. \n\nFirst, I'll look at my hand: 7,1,3,6,3,1,2,7. Let me count the digits I have. I see two 7s, two 1s, two 3s, one 6, and one 2. So, the digits I have are 7,1,3,6,3,1,2,7.\n\nSince I'm starting, I need to make the first bid. The bid has to be a quantity and a digit, and it has to be valid. The maximum possible quantity is 16 because there are 8 digits per player and 2 players, so 16 in total.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 7s. So, if I bid on 7s, I can say that there are at least 3 of them. That way, if the other player doesn't have any 7s, the total would be 2, which is less than my bid, and I would win if challenged. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a different digit. For example, I have two 1s. Bidding 3 1s might be a good option too. But I think starting with 7s is better because 7 is a higher digit, and if I can get away with a higher digit, it might be harder for the opponent to challenge.\n\nWait, but in Liar's Poker, the bid must be strictly higher than the previous bid. Since this is the first bid, I can choose any quantity and digit. I think starting with a lower quantity but a higher digit might be a good strategy because it leaves room for the opponent to either raise the quantity or the digit. But since I have two 7s, I can safely bid 3 7s because if the opponent doesn't have any, I have a good chance of winning if they challenge.\n\nAnother consideration is the likelihood of the opponent having 7s. If I bid 3 7s, and the opponent has none, then the total is 2, which is less than 3, so challenging would win me the game. But if they do have some 7s, my bid might be too low. However, since I'm starting, I have to make a reasonable bid that I can either defend or force the opponent into a difficult spot.\n\nSo, after thinking through, I decide to bid 3 7s. That way, I'm setting a higher digit with a moderate quantity, which could potentially lead the opponent into a tough decision.\n"
