You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn. Let me try to figure out what to do. \n\nFirst, let me look at the game state. My hand is 67706754. So, I have the digits 6, 7, 7, 0, 6, 7, 5, 4. Let me count how many of each digit I have. \n\nLooking at my hand: 6 appears twice, 7 appears three times, 0 once, 5 once, and 4 once. So, I have 2 sixes, 3 sevens, and one each of 0, 5, 4. \n\nThe current bid is 2 1s, made by Player 0. My goal is to either make a higher bid or challenge this bid. \n\nSince I don't have any 1s in my hand, I don't know how many 1s Player 0 might have. But I do know that the total number of 1s across both players could be 2 or more. \n\nNow, if I decide to challenge, and the total number of 1s is 2 or more, Player 0 wins. If it's less than 2, I win. But I have no information about Player 0's hand, so it's hard to tell. \n\nAlternatively, I can make a higher bid. The current bid is 2 1s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or choose a higher digit with the same or higher quantity. \n\nLooking at my hand, I have 3 sevens. So, if I bid 3 7s, that would be a valid higher bid because 7 is higher than 1, and the quantity is higher than 2. \n\nWait, but the current bid is 2 1s. Bidding 3 7s is definitely higher in both quantity and digit. That seems like a good move because I have three 7s, so I can be confident that at least I have three. But what if Player 0 also has some 7s? Then the total could be higher than 3, which would make my bid safe. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid a higher quantity on a lower digit that I have. For example, I have two 6s. So I could bid 3 6s. But since 6 is higher than 1, that would also be a higher bid. But I only have two 6s, so if I bid 3 6s, I'm hoping that Player 0 has at least one 6. If they don't, then the total would be 2, which is less than my bid, and I would lose if challenged. \n\nSo, considering that, bidding 3 7s seems safer because I have three of them, and even if Player 0 has none, the total is exactly 3, which meets my bid. If Player 0 has one or more, then it's even better. \n\nAlternatively, I could also consider bidding 4 of a lower digit, but I don't have enough of any digit except 7 to do that. For example, I have three 7s, so I can't bid 4 of them unless I'm sure Player 0 has at least one. \n\nSo, the safest and most logical move is to bid 3 7s. It's a higher quantity and a higher digit than the current bid, and I have enough in my hand to back it up without needing to rely on Player 0's hand. \n\nTherefore, I'll make the bid of 3 7s.\n"
