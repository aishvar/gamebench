A common opening strategy is to bid on a digit you hold multiple times, as this increases the likelihood the total count is at least that number. I have two 3s and two 0s, so a safe and strategic opening bid is '2 3s' or '2 0s'. Between these, bidding '2 3s' is reasonable and straightforward.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 3\"\n}",
