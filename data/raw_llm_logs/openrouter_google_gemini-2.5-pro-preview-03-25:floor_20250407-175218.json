For the current bid to be true, Player 1 must hold at least two '2's in their 8-digit hand. While possible, challenging this low bid is an option. However, I have strong holdings in '1's (two) and '6's (two). I can make a safe bid of '2 6s' as I hold two '6's. A slightly more assertive bid, leveraging my previous bid ('2 1s') and my hand strength, is '3 1s'. This bid requires only one '1' from Player 1's 8 digits, which is statistically plausible, especially since they didn't challenge my initial '2 1s' bid. Bidding '3 1s' utilizes my hand's strength and increases the bid quantity, putting more pressure on the opponent than the safer '2 6s' bid or a challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 1s\"\n}\n```",
