You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to make the first bid in this game of Liar's Poker. My hand is 54622781. Let me count how many of each digit I have.\n\nLooking at my digits: 5, 4, 6, 2, 2, 7, 8, 1. So breaking it down:\n\n- 0s: 0\n- 1s: 1\n- 2s: 2\n- 3s: 0\n- 4s: 1\n- 5s: 1\n- 6s: 1\n- 7s: 1\n- 8s: 1\n- 9s: 0\n\nSo the highest count in my hand is two 2s. Since there are two players, each with 8 digits, the total possible digits in play are 16. But since the current bid is None, I can start with any valid bid. The first bid has to be at least 1 of any digit, but I want to set a reasonable bid that's not too high but also not too easy to challenge.\n\nIf I start with 2 2s, that's based on my own hand. But the opponent could have more 2s. Alternatively, maybe a higher digit. But since the first bid, maybe starting with a lower quantity but higher digit. Wait, the rules say the bid must be strictly higher than the current bid, which is None. So the first bid can be any quantity and digit, as long as it's a valid bid (i.e., quantity between 1 and 16, digit 0-9). Wait, no, the initial bid just has to be a valid bid, since there's no previous bid. So the first player can bid anything. But strategically, I should start with a bid that's plausible but not too risky.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 2s. If I bid 2 2s, that's truthful based on my own hand, but the opponent could have 0, 1, or more 2s. The total possible 2s could be up to 8 (if the opponent has all 2s, which is unlikely). But starting with 2 2s is a safe opening. Alternatively, maybe a higher digit. For example, if I have a 8, maybe bid 1 8. But that's lower in digit than 2s. Wait, the next player can either bid higher quantity or same quantity with a higher digit. So if I bid 2 2s, the next player could bid 2 3s, 2 4s, etc., or 3 of any digit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher digit to make it harder for the opponent to raise. For example, bid 1 8. Then the opponent has to either bid 2 of any digit or 1 9. But since I have one 8, the opponent could have up to 7 more 8s (since they have 8 digits). But that's unlikely. So 1 8 might be a safer bid. But if the opponent has none, then the total is 1, which matches the bid, so if they challenge, I win. But if they have more, then they can bid higher.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a middle digit. Let's see. My highest count is 2 2s. So if I bid 2 2s, that's a solid starting point. The opponent might have 0, 1, or 2 more 2s. So total could be 2, 3, or 4. If I bid 2 2s, the opponent might think that's possible and either raise or challenge. But since it's the first bid, challenging is unlikely unless they have zero 2s. But they have 8 digits, so the chance they have at least one 2 is possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher quantity but lower digit. For example, 3 1s. But I only have one 1. So the total would be at least 1 (mine) plus whatever the opponent has. If I bid 3 1s, the opponent would need to have at least 2 more. That's possible but risky. If they have none, then the total is 1, which is less than 3, so if they challenge, I lose. But since it's the first bid, maybe they won't challenge immediately. But that's a higher risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with 2 2s. That's based on my own two, so even if the opponent has none, the total is 2, which meets the bid. Wait, no: the bid is the total count across all players. If I bid 2 2s, and the opponent has none, then the total is 2, which is equal to the bid. So the bid is valid. Because the rule says \"count >= bid quantity\". So if I bid 2 2s and the total is exactly 2, then the bid is correct. So if the opponent challenges, they lose. So that's safe. Because even if they have zero, the total is 2 (from me), which meets the bid. So bidding 2 2s is a safe opening. The opponent can't challenge that unless they have zero 2s, but even then, the total is 2, so they lose. Wait, no: if I have two 2s, and the opponent has zero, the total is 2. So if I bid 2 2s, and they challenge, the count is 2, which is equal to the bid, so I win. Therefore, bidding 2 2s is a safe opening because it's guaranteed to be correct. Because I have two 2s, so the total is at least two. Therefore, the bid is valid. So the opponent can't challenge successfully. Therefore, that's a good opening move. Then the opponent has to either bid higher quantity (like 3 of any digit) or same quantity but higher digit (like 2 3s, 2 4s, etc.). \n\nSo the best move here is to bid 2 2s. That's a safe bid because it's based on my own hand, ensuring the total is at least 2. The opponent can't challenge it successfully. Then the game proceeds from there."
