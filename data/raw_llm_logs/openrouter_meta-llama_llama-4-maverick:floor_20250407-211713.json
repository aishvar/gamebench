To assess the likelihood of the bid being correct, I need to consider that there are 8 digits in my hand and 8 in the opponent's hand, making a total of 16 digits. The bid suggests that there are at least 2 '1's across both hands. Since I have 0 '1's, the opponent must have at least 2 '1's for the bid to be valid. Given that the maximum number of '1's I could have is 0, and the bid is relatively low (2 1s), it's plausible that the opponent has at least 2 '1's. I will make a higher bid to continue the game, choosing a higher digit to bid on. I will bid on '2's because my hand has multiple '2's and it's a relatively safe bid to make given the information I have.\", \"action\": \"BID: Q 2s\".replace('Q', '3')}",
