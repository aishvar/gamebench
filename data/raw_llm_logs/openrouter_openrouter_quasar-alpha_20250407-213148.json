Since Player 0 increased the bid from 1 9s to 2 9s, it's plausible they have at least one or two '9's themselves, making the current bid reasonable. Challenging now is risky because two total '9's is quite likely. Instead, I should increase the bid. I don't have any '8's, so increasing the digit is unwise. The next minimal valid bid is 3 9s, but with only one '9' in my hand, it's unlikely there are three total. I do have two '4's, so I can increase the bid to 2 4s, which is a higher digit and equal quantity, making it a valid and safer bid based on my hand's strength.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 4\"\n}",
