You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins.

                    "reasoning": "\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the best move in this Liar's Poker game. Let's break down the information I have.\n\nFirst, my hand is 85187923. That means the digits I have are 8, 5, 1, 8, 7, 9, 2, 3. Let me count how many of each digit I have:\n\n- 8 appears twice.\n- 5, 1, 7, 9, 2, 3 each appear once.\n\nSo, I have two 8s and one each of several other digits.\n\nThe current bid is 3 4s, made by Player 0. The bid history shows that Player 0 started with 2 4s, then Player 1 bid 2 8s, and now Player 0 upped it to 3 4s.\n\nI need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge the current bid.\n\nLet me think about the possible counts of 4s. Since each player has 8 digits, the total number of 4s across both hands can't exceed 16. The current bid is 3, so the actual count could be 3 or more, or less than 3.\n\nIf I challenge, I'm betting that the actual count is less than 3. But do I have any information that suggests that? My hand has no 4s, but Player 0's hand could have some. Without knowing their hand, it's a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, I could make a higher bid. To do that, I need to bid either a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. The current bid is 3 4s. So, a higher bid could be:\n\n- 4 4s (same digit, higher quantity)\n- 3 5s (same quantity, higher digit)\n- Or any combination where either the quantity is higher or the digit is higher, and the overall bid is valid.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 8s. If I bid 4 8s, that would mean I'm claiming there are at least four 8s in total. But wait, I only have two 8s myself. That leaves the possibility that Player 0 has two 8s as well. However, that would make the total four 8s, which would make my bid valid. But if Player 0 doesn't have any 8s, then the total would only be two, which is less than my bid. That's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 5s. Since I have one 5, and Player 0 might have some, but I don't know. It's safer in a way because the digit is higher, but the quantity is the same.\n\nWait, but the current bid is 3 4s. So, if I bid 3 5s, that's a valid higher bid because the digit is higher. But is that a good move? It depends on whether I think there are at least three 5s in total.\n\nI only have one 5, so unless Player 0 has two 5s, the total would be three. If Player 0 doesn't have any 5s, then the total would be one, which is less than 3, and challenging would win. But I don't know Player 0's hand.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the likelihood. Since the current bid is 3 4s, and I have no 4s, the chance that there are three 4s is based on Player 0's hand. They have 8 digits, so they might have three 4s, but it's not certain.\n\nGiven that, challenging might be a good option. If I challenge, and the actual count of 4s is less than 3, I win. If it's 3 or more, Player 0 wins.\n\nBut how likely is it that there are three 4s? My hand has none, so Player 0 would need to have three 4s in their eight digits. That's possible but not very likely. It's a bit of a gamble, but maybe worth it.\n\nAlternatively, if I bid 3 5s, I'm taking a risk that there aren't enough 5s. Since I have one, Player 0 would need to have two more for the total to be three. If they don't have any, then the bid would be invalid, and challenging would win.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should consider the probabilities. The total number of 4s is unknown, but the current bid is 3. If I challenge, I'm betting that there are fewer than 3. Given that I have none, it's possible that Player 0 has two or three. But without more information, it's hard to be certain.\n\nOn the other hand, if I bid 3 5s, I'm making a higher bid, but I'm not sure if there are enough 5s. I have one, so it's possible but not certain.\n\nWait, another option: I could bid 4 4s. That would be a higher quantity than the current bid. But I have zero 4s, so the total would have to be at least four, which would mean Player 0 has four 4s. That's unlikely because they only have eight digits. It's possible, but maybe too risky.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 6s. Since I have no 6s, I'm hoping Player 0 has three. But again, that's a stretch.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the previous bids. Player 0 started with 2 4s, then Player 1 bid 2 8s. Then Player 0 went up to 3 4s. That might indicate that Player 0 thinks there are enough 4s to make the bid. But maybe they're bluffing.\n\nGiven that, challenging might be a good move because if they're bluffing, I can win. But if they're telling the truth, I lose.\n\nAlternatively, making a higher bid with a higher digit might be safer. For example, 3 5s. Since I have one 5, and Player 0 might have two, making the total three. But I don't know.\n\nWait, another angle: the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16, but that's across both players. So, for 4s, the maximum possible is 16, but realistically, it's 8 per player. So, 3 4s is a plausible bid.\n\nBut I have none, so the total could be up to 8 (if Player 0 has all 4s), but that's unlikely. More realistically, Player 0 might have two or three 4s.\n\nGiven that, challenging might be a good option because if the total is less than 3, I win. But if it's 3 or more, I lose.\n\nI think I'll go with challenging because I don't have any 4s, and it's possible that Player 0 doesn't have enough to make the bid valid.\n"
