You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins.

                    "refusal": null,
                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's start by looking at my hand. I have the digits 4, 0, 7, 2, 3, 1, 7, 3. So first, I should count how many of each digit I have. Let's see:\n\n0: 1 (from the 0 in position 2)\n1: 1\n2: 1\n3: 2 (positions 5 and 8)\n4: 1\n7: 2 (positions 3 and 7)\nThe rest (5,6,8,9) I have zero.\n\nSo in my hand, the highest count is two 3s and two 7s. Since the current bid is None, I need to make the opening bid. The goal is to start with a bid that's not too high but also gives me some flexibility. Since I have two 7s and two 3s, maybe starting with the 7s is better because 7 is a higher digit. But wait, the opening bid can be any quantity and digit. But since there are 16 digits in total (8 per player), the maximum possible for any digit is 16, but realistically, the opponent could have up to 8 of a digit. \n\nBut since I have two 7s, maybe starting with a bid that's based on that. Let's say I bid 2 7s. That's a safe opening because I already have two, and the opponent could have up to 6 more. But maybe I can go a little higher to set the tone. Alternatively, since the opponent has 8 digits, maybe they have at least one 7, making the total 3. But that's a gamble. Alternatively, since I have two 3s and two 7s, maybe starting with a lower digit but higher quantity. Wait, but the bid needs to be higher than the current bid, which is None. Since there's no previous bid, the first bid can be anything. Wait, no\u2014the rules say that the first bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'. How does that work? Oh, because in the rules, \"Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\" Wait, that's confusing. Because 'None' isn't a bid, so perhaps the first player can bid any valid bid. Wait, maybe the rule is that the first bid can be any bid, since there's nothing to compare it to. But the problem statement says \"Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\" But how do you compare a bid to 'None'? Maybe the first bid is allowed to be any possible bid. So in that case, the first player can set any quantity and digit. \n\nSo as the first player, I can choose any quantity (1-16) and any digit (0-9). But I want to start with a bid that's reasonable based on my hand. Since I have two 7s, maybe bid 2 7s. But perhaps a better strategy is to start with a higher digit to force the opponent to either challenge or bid higher. Alternatively, since I have two 7s, maybe bid 3 7s, hoping the opponent has at least one. But that's a risk. Alternatively, since I have two 3s and two 7s, maybe choose the digit with the higher count in my hand. Wait, both 3s and 7s are two each. So maybe pick the higher digit (7) and bid 2 of them. \n\nAlternatively, since the opponent has 8 digits, the total possible 7s could be up to 8 (if they have all 7s). But that's unlikely. But if I bid 2 7s, and I have two, the opponent might have 0, making the total 2, which meets the bid. But if they have at least one, then the total is 3, which also meets. So bidding 2 7s is safe. But maybe starting with a higher quantity, like 3 of a lower digit. For example, I have two 3s. If I bid 3 3s, then I need the opponent to have at least one 3. But since I have two, and there are 16 digits total, maybe that's possible. But that's a bit riskier. Alternatively, maybe bid 4 of a digit, like 4 0s. But I have one 0 in my hand. The opponent could have up to 7, making the total 8. But that's a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, since the first bid can be anything, maybe start with a low quantity and a high digit to make the opponent have to bid higher. For example, 1 9. But since I have no 9s, that's risky because the opponent might have none, leading to a challenge. \n\nHmm. So the best approach is to base the first bid on the digits I have, to minimize the risk of being challenged. Since I have two 7s, bidding 2 7s is a safe opening. The opponent might have some 7s, so the total would be at least 2. If they challenge, and the total is exactly 2, then I win. If they have more, then they might bid higher. Alternatively, maybe I can bid a higher quantity on a lower digit where I have more. Wait, but in my hand, the highest counts are two 3s and two 7s. So perhaps 2 7s is better because 7 is a higher digit. \n\nWait, but when you bid, the next player has to either bid higher in quantity or same quantity with a higher digit. So if I bid 2 7s, the next player can bid 2 8s or 2 9s, or 3 of any digit. So maybe starting with a higher digit would limit their options. Alternatively, starting with a lower digit but higher quantity. For example, if I bid 3 3s. Since I have two 3s, the opponent needs at least one. But if they don't have any, the total is 2, which is less than 3, so they might challenge. But since it's the first bid, they might think I have some and not challenge. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a safer approach is to start with a low quantity but a high digit. For example, 1 9. But I have no 9s, so the total would depend on the opponent. If they have one 9, then the total is 1. But if I bid 1 9, then the opponent can challenge, and if they have none, I lose. So that's risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 2 3s. I have two, so the total is at least two. If the opponent challenges, they lose. But if they have more 3s, they can bid higher. \n\nWait, but the first bid has to be a valid bid. So since the current bid is None, any bid is acceptable. So the safest opening would be to bid a quantity equal to the number I have in my hand, assuming the opponent has at least zero. For example, if I have two 7s, bid 2 7s. That way, even if the opponent has none, the total is two, which meets the bid. If they challenge, I win. So that's a safe bid. \n\nBut maybe I can go a bit higher. For instance, bid 3 3s. Since I have two, the opponent needs at least one. But if they don't have any, the total is two, which is less than three, so if they challenge, I lose. But if they don't challenge, they have to bid higher. So perhaps that's a bit risky. \n\nAlternatively, since I have two 7s, maybe bid 2 7s. That's safe because even if the opponent has none, the total is two. But if they have some, the total is higher. So that's a solid opening. \n\nTherefore, the best initial bid would be 2 7s. That's based on my hand, and it's a safe bid that's unlikely to be challenged because the opponent would have to assume I have at least one. Even if they have none, the total is two, so challenging would make them lose. So I should go with that.\n"
