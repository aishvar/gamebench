        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '4 8s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

                    "reasoning": "\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the current bid is 4 8s, made by Player 1. My hand is 82630814. Let me count how many 8s I have. Looking at my digits: 8, 2, 6, 3, 0, 8, 1, 4. I have two 8s in my hand. \n\nSince each player has 8 digits, the total across both hands is 16. The current bid is 4 8s, meaning the bidder is claiming there are at least four 8s in total. \n\nI have two 8s, so the other player must have two 8s for the total to be four. But considering that Player 1 just increased the bid from 3 8s to 4 8s, they might be trying to bluff or they might actually have more 8s. \n\nIf I challenge, the actual count will be revealed. If the total is less than 4, I win. If it's equal or more, Player 1 wins. Since I only have two 8s, the other player would need at least two more 8s for the total to reach four. \n\nIs it likely that Player 1 has two 8s? It's possible, but considering the limited number of digits, it might be a stretch. Maybe they're trying to bluff because they don't have enough 8s. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid higher, I could go for a higher quantity or a higher digit. But the next bid has to be strictly higher. The current bid is 4 8s. To bid higher, I could either increase the quantity to 5 with any digit (preferably a higher one) or keep the quantity the same and choose a higher digit, like 4 9s. \n\nLooking at my hand, I have digits 8, 2, 6, 3, 0, 8, 1, 4. The highest digit I have is 8, so if I wanted to bid a higher digit with the same quantity, I could go for 4 9s. But I don't have any 9s, so that's not based on my hand. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid 5 of a lower digit, but that might not be credible if I don't have enough of that digit. For example, if I bid 5 0s, but I only have one 0. That's risky. \n\nChallenging seems like a safer option because if the total is less than 4, I win. If I'm wrong and there are four or more 8s, I lose. But given that I only have two 8s, the chance of the other player having two is possible, but maybe not probable. \n\nWait, but if I challenge and lose, I have to reveal my hand. But if I bid and lose, I also reveal my hand. So, maybe challenging is better because it's a direct test of the current claim. \n\nAnother angle: since the bid went from 3 to 4, maybe Player 1 is trying to increase the pressure, thinking I don't have enough 8s. If I challenge, I can test that. \n\nI think challenging is the better move here because the bid seems high given my hand, and I'm not sure if Player 1 can back it up.\n"
