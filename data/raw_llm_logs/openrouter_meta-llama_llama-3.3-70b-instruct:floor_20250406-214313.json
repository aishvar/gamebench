You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

Since I have to make a bid that is strictly higher, I could either increase the quantity or the digit. However, without any 9s in my hand, bidding on 9s seems risky. I also see that I have multiple occurrences of the digit '2', '3', '4', and '8'. Considering the next possible digits and their quantities, a reasonable bid could involve increasing the quantity of a digit I have or moving to a higher digit if I had enough occurrences. Since '2 9s' is the current bid and I don't have enough information to safely bid higher on 9s or move to a higher digit with confidence, I should consider the overall distribution and my chances. Given the lack of 9s in my hand and the need for a strictly higher bid, challenging seems less favorable without a strong indication the bid is incorrect. Thus, considering my hand and the need to bid higher, I must strategically choose a digit and quantity that are reasonable based on what I have and the bidding history. Since I have two '2's, two '4's, and two '8's, and the current bid is '2 9s', I could consider bidding on a digit I have in abundance, but I must bid higher. Given the constraints and aiming for a safe increase, I could consider digits higher than 9, but since 9 is the highest digit, my only option is to increase quantity. However, I don't have enough of any single digit to confidently bid higher than '2' of any digit above 9 (since there's no digit above 9). Therefore, my strategy should involve either challenging based on the improbability of the current bid or making a calculated bid based on the digits I do have, keeping in mind the total possible occurrences of any digit are limited to 16 across both players. Given these considerations and without specific insight into Player 1's hand, my best course of action, considering I must bid higher and the constraints of the game, is to make a strategic decision based on the information available.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 4s\"\n}",
