Since the total digits between both players are 16, and I have none, the opponent must have at least one '2' for their bid to be valid. A single '2' in their hand is quite plausible, so challenging now would be risky. Instead, I can safely make a minimal higher bid. The next valid bids are either increasing the quantity to 2 of any digit, or 1 of a higher digit than 2. Looking at my hand, I have two '1's, two '0's, one '3', one '4', one '6', one '8', and one '9'. I have two '1's, so bidding 2 '1's is both safe and minimal. This is a valid increase over 1 '2's.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 1s\"\n}",
