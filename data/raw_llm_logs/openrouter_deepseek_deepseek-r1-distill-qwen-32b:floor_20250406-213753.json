        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

                    "reasoning": "\nAlright, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my first turn. The current bid is None, which means I have to make the first bid. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll look at my hand: 8,1,6,1,7,5,3,2. Let's count the digits I have:\n\n- 8: 1\n- 1: 2\n- 6: 1\n- 7: 1\n- 5: 1\n- 3: 1\n- 2: 1\n\nSo, the digits I have are 8,1,6,7,5,3,2. The digit 1 appears twice, which is the highest count in my hand.\n\nSince I'm the first to bid, I need to make a bid that's likely to be true but also gives me a good chance of winning. Starting with a low bid is usually a good strategy to avoid being challenged early on.\n\nLooking at the digits, I have two 1s. Maybe I can bid 3 1s. That way, I'm assuming there's at least one more 1 in the opponent's hand. It's a reasonable assumption because in a game of 16 digits total, it's possible for the opponent to have another 1.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid a lower quantity with a higher digit, but since I have two 1s, starting with 1s makes sense. Bidding 3 1s is a safe starting point that's not too high, giving me room to increase the bid in future turns if needed.\n\nI should also consider the possibility that the opponent might challenge if they think the bid is too high. But since I'm starting with 3 1s, which is a moderate bid, it's less likely to be challenged immediately.\n\nSo, after considering all this, I think the best move is to bid 3 1s.\n"
