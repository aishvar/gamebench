Since I hold zero 9s, the entire count would have to come from Player 1's hand. For Player 1 to have two or more 9s is possible but somewhat unlikely, though not implausible. However, since Player 1 increased from 2 8s (where I know I have two 8s, so that bid was safe) to 2 9s, it may be a bluff to push me into a risky higher bid. Given the uncertainty and that I have no 9s, challenging here is strategically sound rather than making a risky higher bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
