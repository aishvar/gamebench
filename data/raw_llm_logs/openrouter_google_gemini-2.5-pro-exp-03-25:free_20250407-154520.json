The current bid is '4 6s', meaning the bidder claims there are at least four 6s across all 16 digits (both players' hands). I have zero 6s in my hand. Therefore, for the bid to be true, the other player (Player 0) must hold at least four 6s in their 8-digit hand. The statistical probability of having four or more of a specific digit in an 8-card hand (where each digit is drawn randomly from 0-9) is very low (around 0.5%). Since I possess none of the required digit, the burden falls entirely on the opponent having an exceptionally rare hand distribution for this specific digit. Thus, the bid is highly likely to be false.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\n```",
