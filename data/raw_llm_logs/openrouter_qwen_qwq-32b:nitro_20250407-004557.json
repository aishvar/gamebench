You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to make the first bid in this Liar's Poker game. The current bid is None, so my first move has to be a valid bid. The rules say that a bid must be strictly higher than the current bid, but since there's nothing before, I can start with any bid. But I should choose something that's plausible based on my hand and maybe try to set a trap or something.\n\nMy hand is 21163405. Let me list out the digits I have: 2, 1, 1, 6, 3, 4, 0, 5. Let's count how many of each digit I have here. \n\nLooking at each digit:\n\n- 0: 1 (the 0 in my hand)\n- 1: 2 (the two 1s)\n- 2: 1\n- 3: 1\n- 4: 1\n- 5: 1\n- 6: 1\n- The other digits (7,8,9) aren't present in my hand.\n\nSo the counts in my hand are as above. Since the total digits between both players are 16, the opponent has 8 digits. I need to make a bid that's higher than nothing. The bid has to be a quantity and a digit. The bid can be any starting point, but I want to pick something that's not too easy to challenge but also gives me a chance.\n\nIf I start with a low quantity but a high digit, maybe that's better. For example, bidding 3 9s. Since I have zero 9s, but maybe the opponent might have one or two? But 3 might be a stretch. Alternatively, maybe go with a digit I have more of. I have two 1s. So, the total possible 1s could be up to 2 + whatever the opponent has. If I bid 3 1s, then that's possible if the opponent has at least one 1. But maybe that's a safer bid? Or maybe start with a higher digit but lower quantity?\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a bid that's a bit higher but not too risky. Let's think. The first bid can be anything, but the next player has to top it. If I bid 3 5s, that's okay. Wait, but I have a 5 in my hand. So the total could be 1 (mine) plus whatever the opponent has. To reach 3, the opponent would need at least two 5s. Maybe that's possible, but maybe not. Alternatively, if I bid 2 1s, but that's not higher than nothing. Wait, the first bid just needs to be a valid bid. The rules say \"your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'\", so the first bid can be any quantity and digit as long as it's a valid bid (quantity between 1 and 16, digit 0-9). But the next player has to top it. So maybe starting with a lower quantity but a high digit might be better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a bid that's based on my own digits. Since I have two 1s, maybe bid 3 1s. That way, if the opponent doesn't have any, then when challenged, the total would be 2, which is less than 3, so I would lose. But if I bid 3 1s, maybe the opponent might think it's too high and challenge, but if they do, then I lose. Hmm, risky. Alternatively, bid 2 1s, but that's the exact count I have. But since the opponent could have more, maybe?\n\nAlternatively, maybe pick a digit I don't have. Like 0. I have one 0. If I bid 2 0s, then maybe the opponent has one, making it 2. That's safe. But then the next player can top it by going higher. Alternatively, start with a higher digit. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with 3 6s. I have one 6. So opponent would need two more. Possible but maybe not. Alternatively, 3 3s. I have one 3. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with 4 0s. But I only have one 0, so that's a big risk. Probably not.\n\nWait, the first bid can be anything. The key is to choose a bid that's not too easy to challenge but gives me an advantage. Let's think of the bid that's hardest to challenge. Since I have two 1s, maybe start with 3 1s. That gives me a base, and if the opponent has at least one, it's true. If they don't, then maybe they'll call challenge. Alternatively, maybe go for a higher digit with a lower count. For example, 2 9s. Since I have none, but maybe the opponent has one, so total is 1, which is less than 2. But if I bid 2 9s, then the opponent might think \"there's no way there are two 9s\", and challenge, which would make me lose. So that's risky.\n\nAlternatively, bid 3 5s. I have one 5. The opponent could have two, making it 3. Possible but maybe not. Alternatively, start with 2 6s. I have one, so opponent needs one more. That's possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a bid that's a bit higher in quantity. Since the first bid can be anything, maybe start with 4 of a digit I have two of. Like 4 1s. Then the total would be 2 plus whatever the opponent has. If opponent has two, that's 4. So that's possible. But if I bid 4 1s, and they have none, then the total is 2, which is less than 4, so challenging would win them. So maybe that's too risky.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, start with a low quantity but a high digit. Like 1 9. But that's the minimum possible. The next player can just increase the quantity to 2 9s, so that might not be effective. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with 3 2s. I have one 2, so opponent needs two. Maybe possible. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the safest bid. The bid that has the highest chance of being true. Since I have two 1s, 2 1s is exactly my count, so the opponent could have 0 to 8 more. If I bid 3 1s, there's a chance they have at least one. Maybe that's better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with 3 0s. Since I have one 0, opponent would need two more. That's possible but maybe not.\n\nWait, the first move is crucial. The opponent can choose to either raise or challenge. If I start with 3 1s, opponent might think \"I have zero 1s, so total is 2, so I can challenge and win\". But if they do have a 1, they won't. Alternatively, maybe they have a 1, so they might raise to 4 1s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a digit that I have more of. Like 2 1s, but since that's exactly my count, maybe it's better to go higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe pick a digit I don't have, but which is common. Like 3 5s. Since I have one, maybe the opponent has two. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best first move is to bid 3 of a digit I have two of. Let's see: I have two 1s. So 3 1s. That's a possible bid, and if the opponent has at least one, it's true. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 3 6s, but I have only one. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should start with a bid that's a bit higher in quantity but on a lower digit, so that the opponent can't easily challenge. \n\nWait, another approach: since the first bid can be anything, maybe start with a bid that's easy to top, so that the opponent has to make a higher bid, making it easier for me to challenge later. For example, if I bid 2 1s, then opponent can go to 3 1s, then I can challenge. But maybe that's a strategy. \n\nAlternatively, if I start with a higher bid, like 4 1s, then opponent might challenge if they don't have enough. \n\nHmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think of the example given. In Example 1, the user had two 6s and bid 4 6s, which is higher in both quantity and digit. So maybe the strategy is to bid higher than necessary but using a digit you have some of. \n\nIn my case, I have two 1s. Maybe bid 3 1s. That's a reasonable bid. Alternatively, since I have two 1s, maybe bid 3 1s. That way, if the opponent has even one, it's valid, and if they have none, then the total is 2, which is less than 3, so challenging would win them. But maybe the opponent doesn't have any, but I have to consider the chance. Alternatively, since I have two, maybe the opponent has a 50% chance? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe pick a digit I don't have but which is lower, so that the opponent might not have many. Like 3 0s. Since I have one, opponent has to have two. Maybe they don't. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a bid on a higher digit. Let's see, the digits I have are 0,1,1,2,3,4,5,6. The highest digit I have is 6. So maybe bid 2 6s. Since I have one, opponent needs one. That's possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 2 6s is too easy to top. Like opponent can go to 3 6s. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe start with a bid on a digit I don't have, but which is high, making it less likely they have many. Like 3 9s. Since I have none, opponent might have none too, so challenging would win them. But that's risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with 1 9s. That's the minimum, but then opponent can easily raise. \n\nAlternatively, the safest bid might be to go with 3 of the digit I have two of, which is 1. So bid 3 1s. That gives me a decent chance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 2 1s, but that's exactly my count, so opponent can challenge if they think I'm lying, but since it's my first bid, maybe they won't. \n\nWait, the rules say the bid must be strictly higher than the current bid, but since current is None, any bid is allowed. So the first bid can be any quantity and digit. \n\nHmm. Let's see what's the best starting bid. Maybe the standard strategy is to start with a mid-range bid. Let's see, in the example, they bid 4 6s when they had two. So maybe it's better to overbid a bit but on a digit you have some. \n\nIn my case, I have two 1s. Maybe bid 3 1s. That way, if the opponent has at least one, it's valid. If not, then challenging would beat me, but maybe the chance is worth it. Alternatively, if I bid 3 6s, which I have one, opponent needs two. Maybe that's less likely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe go for a higher digit but lower quantity. Like 2 9s. Since I have none, opponent might have one, making it 1, which is less than 2. So challenging would win them. That's risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with 4 0s. Since I have one, opponent needs three. Unlikely. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best move is to bid 3 1s. That's a reasonable bid, and since I have two, there's a chance opponent has at least one. Let's go with that."
