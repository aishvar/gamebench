        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let's see, the game state shows that it's my turn as Player 0, and there's no current bid yet. My hand is 86752461, which I can break down into individual digits: 8, 6, 7, 5, 2, 4, 6, 1. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze my own digits to see what I can bid. Let me count how many of each digit I have. The digit 6 appears twice, 8 once, 7 once, 5 once, 2 once, 4 once, and 1 once. So my highest quantity is two 6s. \n\nSince the current bid is None, I can start the bidding. I have to make a bid that's higher than None, which just means any valid bid. The rules say that a bid can be any quantity and digit, as long as it's possible. The maximum quantity is 16 because there are 16 digits in total (each player has 8). \n\nI should consider what digit to bid on. I have two 6s, which is a decent starting point. Bidding on a higher digit might be risky because the opponent could have more, but since I have two, it's a safe start. Alternatively, I could bid on a lower digit with the same quantity, but starting with a higher digit might give me an advantage.\n\nI think bidding 2 6s is a good move because it's based on my actual count, and it's a reasonable starting point. It doesn't overcommit me, and it's a truthful bid, which is strategic because if the opponent challenges, I can win. Plus, since there are no previous bids, I can set the tone for the game.\n\nI don't see any reason to challenge because there's no bid to challenge yet. So, the best action is to make a bid. I'll go with 2 6s because that's what I have, and it's a solid foundation for the game.\n"
