Since I have zero 4s, all of these would have to be in Player 0's hand. Given typical digit distribution, it's somewhat unlikely Player 0 holds two or more 4s, but not impossible. However, since 2 is a conservative opening bid, it's plausible. A safe approach is to make a minimal higher bid to continue gathering information, rather than challenge immediately. I will increase the digit while keeping the quantity the same, moving to 2 5s, which is a valid next bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 5s\"\n}",
