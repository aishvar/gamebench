To reach 3 total 4s, the opponent would need at least one 4, which is quite likely given their 8 digits. So 3 4s is a plausible bid and not worth challenging. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity to 4 4s, which would require the opponent to have at least two 4s (since I only have two), or I can bid 3 5s. I have two 5s in my hand, so a bid of 3 5s would require the opponent to have at least one 5, which is reasonable. Since 3 5s is a valid next bid and safer than jumping to 4 4s, I will bid 3 5s.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 5s\"\n}",
