        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s.

                    "reasoning": "\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation. \n\nFirst, I have my hand: 7, 3, 2, 8, 6, 5, 9, 1. That's eight digits. Since it's the first move, the current bid is None, so I have to make the initial bid. \n\nI remember the rules say that each bid must be strictly higher than the previous one, either by quantity or by digit if the quantity is the same. But since this is the first bid, I just need to make a reasonable starting point.\n\nLooking at my hand, I want to choose a digit that I have multiple of because that gives me some confidence. Let's count how many of each digit I have:\n\n- 7: 1\n- 3: 1\n- 2: 1\n- 8: 1\n- 6: 1\n- 5: 1\n- 9: 1\n- 1: 1\n\nHmm, each digit appears only once in my hand. That's not helpful. Maybe I should look for a digit that's more likely to appear in the opponent's hand as well. Or perhaps pick a digit that's less common, making it harder for the opponent to have many of them.\n\nWait, the maximum possible quantity is 16 because there are two players with 8 digits each. So if I bid too high, the opponent can challenge and win if the actual count is lower.\n\nSince I don't have any duplicates in my hand, I have to base my bid on the assumption that the opponent might have some of the same digits. Let's think about which digits are more likely to appear multiple times.\n\nDigits like 0, 1, or 5 might be more common, but I don't have a lot of information. Alternatively, higher digits like 8 or 9 might be less common, but again, I'm not sure.\n\nMaybe I should start with a low bid to see how the opponent reacts. If I bid 1 of a higher digit, say 7, that might be too low. Or maybe 2 of a mid-digit.\n\nWait, since I have to make the first bid, maybe I should choose a digit I have and bid a quantity that's just slightly higher than what I have. But since I only have one of each, I can't really base it on my own count. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 of a digit that I don't have, hoping that the opponent has one or two. But that's risky because if they don't, I could be challenged.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's safer to bid a lower quantity on a higher digit. For example, 2 7s. That way, if the opponent doesn't have any 7s, I can challenge if they go higher. Or if they do have some, it's a manageable bid.\n\nWait, but since I have a 7, maybe I can assume the opponent might have one or two. So 2 7s seems reasonable. That gives me a starting point without overcommitting.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I'll bid 2 7s. It's a moderate starting bid, and I have a 7 in my hand, which gives me some confidence that there might be at least two in total.\n"
