        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 5s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

Since I have 1, that means Player 0 would need to have at least 2 fives for this bid to be valid. This is certainly possible. I also have two 1s in my hand, which suggests my previous bid of 3 1s was safe. Looking at my options, I could bid 4 5s, but that seems risky since I only have 1. I could bid 3 6s (same quantity, higher digit), which is safer since I don\\'t need to increase the quantity. I have zero 6s, but the opponent would need to have at least 3 for this to be valid, which is possible but less likely than the current bid. I could also bid 3 7s or 3 8s (I have one 8), or even 4 of a lower digit like 4 1s (I have two 1s). Given my hand, bidding 3 6s seems reasonable as it\\'s the minimum valid raise.\", \"action\": \"BID: 3 6s\"}', type='text')"
