You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn to make a bid. The game state shows that there are no previous bids, so the current bid is 'None'. My hand is '07157695'. I need to decide whether to make a bid or challenge, but since it's the first move, I can't challenge because there's nothing to challenge yet. So I have to make a bid.\n\nFirst, I should look at my hand to see which digits I have. Let's break it down: 0, 7, 1, 5, 7, 6, 9, 5. So, I have two 5s and two 7s. The other digits\u20140, 1, 6, 9\u2014appear once each. \n\nSince the goal is to bid on the total count of a specific digit across both players' hands, I need to think about which digit I can bid on that gives me the best chance of winning. I know my own digits, but I don't know the opponent's. So I have to make an educated guess based on probability.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 5s and two 7s. That means, at minimum, there are two of each in the total pool. But the opponent could have more of these digits, or they might have none. If I bid on 5s or 7s, I can potentially set a higher quantity, but I have to consider what's reasonable.\n\nIf I bid on 5s, for example, I can say at least 2 5s. But maybe I can go higher. Since I have two, the opponent could have up to 14 more (since there are 16 digits in total, 8 each). But that's the maximum, so it's unlikely. However, in Liar's Poker, players usually start with lower bids to avoid being challenged.\n\nAlternatively, I could look at the digits I have only one of. For instance, 0, 1, 6, or 9. Bidding on these might be riskier because if the opponent doesn't have any, the total could be just 1, which is lower than my bid. But if I bid 1 on any of these, it's safe because I know I have at least one. But since the current bid is none, I can start with the lowest possible bid, which is 1 of any digit.\n\nBut wait, the rules say that a bid must be strictly higher than the current bid, which is 'None'. So my first bid can be any quantity and digit, as long as it's valid. The minimum is 1 of any digit. However, in Liar's Poker, starting with a low bid might not be the best strategy because it gives the opponent an easy way to challenge or overbid. But since it's the first move, I have to pick something.\n\nConsidering that, maybe I should bid on a digit I have multiple of, to increase the chances that the total is at least that. So, for 5s, I can bid 2 5s. That's a safe bet because I have two, and the opponent might have more. Alternatively, I could bid 3 5s, hoping the opponent has at least one. But that's a bit risky because if they have none, I lose.\n\nSimilarly, for 7s, I have two. So bidding 2 7s is safe, or 3 if I'm feeling optimistic. But again, without knowing the opponent's hand, it's a gamble.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the distribution of digits. Since digits are from 0-9, and each player has 8, it's possible that some digits are more common. But without more information, it's hard to tell.\n\nI think the safest move is to bid on a digit I have at least two of, and start with a low quantity. So, I'll choose 2 5s or 2 7s. Between these, 5s might be a better choice because 5 is a middle digit, and perhaps less likely to be bid on immediately. Alternatively, 7 is a high digit, which might be more tempting for other players to challenge.\n\nWait, but since it's the first bid, the opponent can either challenge or overbid. If I bid 2 5s, the opponent might challenge if they think there aren't enough 5s. But since I have two, and the opponent could have up to 6 more (since there are 8 digits each, but I have 2, so opponent can have up to 6), the total could be up to 8. But the opponent might not have any, making the total 2. So if I bid 2 5s, and the opponent challenges, I would win because the total is at least 2.\n\nAlternatively, if I bid 3 5s, and the opponent has none, I lose. So 2 is safer.\n\nBut wait, the rules say that when you challenge, if the count is equal to or higher than the bid, the bidder wins. So if I bid 2 5s and the total is exactly 2, I still win. Therefore, bidding 2 5s is a safe move because the worst case is that the opponent has none, and I still have exactly 2, so I win the challenge.\n\nTherefore, I'll bid 2 5s.\n"
