You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and I need to figure out my next move. Let me start by understanding the game state. \n\nMy hand is 85890616. Let me list out my digits: 8, 5, 8, 9, 0, 6, 1, 6. So I have two 8s, one 5, one 9, one 0, two 6s, and one 1. That's eight digits total, which makes sense because each player has eight.\n\nThe current bid is 3 6s, made by Player 0. My turn is next, so I can either bid higher or challenge. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the current bid. Player 0 is claiming that there are at least three 6s in total between both players. I have two 6s in my hand, so if Player 0 has at least one 6, the total would be three. But I don't know Player 0's hand, so I can't be certain.\n\nI have two 6s, so the minimum possible total 6s is two (if Player 0 has none) and the maximum is ten (if Player 0 has eight 6s, but that's impossible because each player only has eight digits). So the realistic maximum is 2 (mine) + 8 (theirs) = 10, but that's only if they have all 6s, which is unlikely.\n\nGiven that the current bid is 3, I need to decide whether to challenge or bid higher. If I challenge, I'm betting that the total number of 6s is less than three. Since I have two, Player 0 must have at least one for the bid to be valid. If they have one, the total is exactly three, so the bid is correct, and I would lose the challenge. If they have zero, I win. But I don't know their hand.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to bid higher. The next possible bids could be 4 of a higher digit or 3 of a higher digit. Let's see what digits are possible. \n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 8s. So if I bid 3 8s, that would be a valid bid because it's the same quantity as the current bid but a higher digit (8 is higher than 6). But do I think there are at least three 8s in total? I have two, so Player 0 would need at least one. If they have one, total is three. If they have more, it's higher. But if they have none, the bid would be invalid. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid 4 6s, increasing the quantity. Since I have two, Player 0 would need at least two more, making the total four. But I don't know if they have that many.\n\nAnother option is to look for other digits I have multiple of. I have two 8s and two 6s. No other duplicates. So 3 8s or 4 6s are my options for bidding higher.\n\nI think bidding 3 8s is safer because 8 is a higher digit than 6, so it's a stronger bid. Plus, even if Player 0 has one 8, the total is three, which makes my bid valid. If they have more, it's even better. If they have none, then my bid would be invalid, but I'm taking a calculated risk.\n\nAlternatively, challenging the current bid might be risky because if Player 0 has at least one 6, I lose. Since I have two, they only need one to make the bid correct. It's possible they have at least one, so challenging might not be the best move.\n\nSo, I think the best action is to bid 3 8s, increasing the digit from 6 to 8 while keeping the quantity the same. This is a valid higher bid and leverages the two 8s I have, hoping that Player 0 has at least one more.\n"
