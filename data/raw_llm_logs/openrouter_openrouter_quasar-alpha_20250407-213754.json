The current bid is 3 4s, meaning there must be at least three '4's across both hands. Given I only have one, Player 1 would need to have at least two '4's for the bid to be valid. The probability of having two or more '4's in a random 8-digit hand is moderate but not guaranteed. Since it's plausible but not certain, a safe strategic approach is to raise the bid conservatively. The smallest valid raise is to increase the digit with the same quantity, moving to 3 5s. I have one '5', so again Player 1 would need to have at least two '5's, which is similarly plausible. Alternatively, I could increase the quantity to 4 of any digit. Looking at my hand, I have one '3', one '5', one '4', one '6', one '7', one '9', one '2', and one '0', so no digit appears more than once. Thus, raising the quantity would be riskier. Therefore, the best move is to bid 3 5s.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 5s\"\n}",
