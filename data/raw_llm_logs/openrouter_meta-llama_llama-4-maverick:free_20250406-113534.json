        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 4 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '8 5s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 32 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.",

                    "content": "To determine the best action, let's first analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Your Hand**: 55155882 - This hand contains 5 fives, 2 eights, and 1 two.\n2. **Current Bid**: 8 5s by Player 0.\n3. **Bid History**: The bidding has been quite aggressive, with a focus on both 5s and 1s at different points.\n\nGiven that the current bid is 8 5s, to make a higher bid, you need to either bid a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit.\n\nLet's analyze your hand and the current bid:\n- You have 5 fives in your hand. The total number of fives across all players is at least 8 (as per the current bid), and since you have 5 of them, the remaining 3 players must have at least 3 fives among them.\n- The current bid of 8 5s seems plausible because you have a significant number of 5s, and it's possible the other players have the remaining 3.\n\nTo make a higher bid than 8 5s, you could either bid a higher quantity (e.g., 9 Xs) or the same quantity with a higher digit (e.g., 8 6s or higher).\n\nLet's consider your options:\n1. **Bidding a Higher Quantity**: You could bid 9 5s. Given that you have 5 fives, the other 3 players need to have at least 4 more fives among them, which is possible but seems a bit aggressive given the distribution so far.\n   \n2. **Bidding the Same Quantity with a Higher Digit**: The next higher digit than 5 is 6, but you don't have any 6s. You could bid 8 8s. You have 2 eights, so the other players would need to have 6 eights among them. This is a significant number but not impossible.\n\nLet's evaluate the likelihood and potential outcomes:\n- Bidding 9 5s: This requires the other players to have at least 4 fives, which is plausible given the history (Player 0 bid 8 5s, and previously, there were bids on 5s).\n- Bidding 8 8s: This seems like a reasonable bid because you have 2 eights, and it's possible the other players have a substantial number of eights.\n\nGiven these considerations, bidding 8 8s seems like a reasonable action because:\n- You're not increasing the quantity, which might be challenging to justify given the total number of digits (32).\n- You're switching to a digit (8) where you have some presence (2 eights), and it's plausible the others have a significant number as well.\n\nThus, your action could be to bid 8 8s.\n\nHere's your response in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 8 5s. I have 5 fives and 2 eights in my hand. Bidding 8 8s is a reasonable action as it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit. It's plausible that the other players have a significant number of 8s.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 8 8s\"\n}\n```",
