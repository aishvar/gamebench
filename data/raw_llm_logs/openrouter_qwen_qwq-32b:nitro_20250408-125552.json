You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to make the first bid in this Liar's Poker game. Since the current bid is None, my first move has to be a valid bid. The rules say that each player has 8 digits, so total digits are 16. The bid has to be a quantity and a digit. The first bid can be any starting point, but I should choose something that's plausible based on my hand and maybe set up a good strategy.\n\nLooking at my hand: 10940985. Let me list out the digits: 1, 0, 9, 4, 0, 9, 8, 5. Let's count the occurrences of each digit here. \n\nBreaking it down:\n- 0 appears twice (positions 2 and 5)\n- 1 appears once\n- 4 once\n- 5 once\n- 8 once\n- 9 appears twice (positions 3 and 7)\n\nSo in my hand, the digits with counts are 0 (2), 9 (2), and the rest are single. Since I need to make a bid that's higher than \"None\", which means I can start with any bid. But the best first move is usually to bid low but in a way that's hard to challenge immediately. \n\nThe common strategy is to start with a low quantity, maybe 2 or 3, but pick a digit that's present in your hand. Since I have two 0s and two 9s, maybe choosing one of those. Let's see. If I bid 3 0s, that's claiming there are at least three 0s in total. Since I have two, the opponent could have one. But maybe that's risky if they don't have any. Alternatively, bidding 3 9s, since I have two, so needing one more from the opponent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe starting with a lower digit but higher quantity? Wait, but the first bid can be anything. Let's think of what's safest. Maybe starting with 2 of a digit I have. But since it's the first bid, the next player can raise either the quantity or the digit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a bid that's easy to build upon. Let's see, if I bid 2 0s, that's low, but maybe the next player can go to 3 0s or 2 1s. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe start with a bid that's a bit higher. Since I have two 0s, maybe bid 3 0s. That way, if the opponent doesn't have a 0, they might challenge. But if they do have one, then the total would be 3. Alternatively, if I bid 2 9s, that's also possible, but maybe 3 9s would be better since 9 is a higher digit. \n\nWait, the bid needs to be higher than the previous. Since it's the first bid, any bid is allowed. But to set up for future moves, maybe choosing a digit that's less common. Alternatively, starting with a bid that's likely to be true. Since I have two 0s, bidding 3 0s requires the opponent to have at least one 0. If they don't, then challenging would win. But maybe the opponent has a 0, so it's safer. Alternatively, maybe 2 9s. Let me think of possible counts. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a bid on a digit I have two of, so 0 or 9. Let's see. If I bid 3 0s, then the opponent could have 0, 1, or maybe more. But since I have two, if they have one, total is 3. If they have none, then it's 2, so challenging would win. So maybe that's a good starting bid. Alternatively, 3 9s. Since I have two, same logic. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a lower quantity but higher digit. For example, 2 9s. But then the next player could raise to 3 9s, which I might not be able to call. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe go for a middle ground. Let's see, the first bid is often a low number to set the stage. Maybe 3 0s. Let me check my hand again. My hand has two 0s, so if I bid 3 0s, that's possible if the opponent has one. The opponent has 8 digits. If they have a 0, then total is 3. If not, then I'm lying. But since I'm starting, maybe that's a reasonable bid. Alternatively, maybe 2 9s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe pick a digit that's less likely. For example, 8 is present once in my hand. Bidding 2 8s. But that might be riskier. \n\nHmm. Since I have two of 0 and two of 9, those are the highest counts in my hand. So maybe starting with a bid on either of those. Let's pick 0. So bid 3 0s. That gives me a base. Alternatively, 3 9s. \n\nWait, 9 is a higher digit, so if I bid 3 9s, the next player could either increase quantity to 4 or same quantity but higher digit like 3 9s to 3 10s but digits go up to 9. Wait, digits are 0-9, so 9 is the highest digit. So if I bid 3 9s, the next player can't raise the digit beyond 9, so they have to raise the quantity to 4 or more. \n\nAlternatively, starting with 3 9s might be better because the digit is high, so it's harder for the opponent to raise the digit. Since 9 is the highest, they can't go higher, so they have to increase quantity. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with 2 9s. Let's see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first bid should be as low as possible to not get challenged immediately. Let's see, if I bid 2 0s. Since I have two, that's exactly my count. The opponent could have 0-8, so total could be 2 to 10. But bidding 2 0s is a very low bid. The next player can easily raise to 3 0s or 2 1s, etc. \n\nHmm. The best first move is usually to bid in a way that's somewhat plausible but leaves room for others to overbid. Since I have two of 0 and two of 9, maybe starting with 3 of either. Let me think of the probabilities. \n\nIf I bid 3 0s: opponent has 8 digits. The chance they have at least one 0? Assuming digits are random, but since it's a poker game, maybe they have some too. But since I have two, maybe it's possible. Alternatively, 3 9s. \n\nAlternatively, since 9 is a high digit, maybe people have fewer of them. But I have two. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe start with a bid that's a bit higher but not too extreme. Let's go with 3 0s. That's a safe bid because I have two, so even if the opponent has one, it's valid. If they have none, then challenging would win. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 2 9s. Let's see. \n\nWait, the bid has to be the first, so any bid is allowed. Let me pick the highest possible digit I have with at least two, which is 9. So bid 3 9s. That way, the next player can't go higher in digit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 3 0s. \n\nHmm. I think starting with 3 0s might be better because 0 is a common digit? Not sure. Alternatively, 3 9s is a higher digit, so better. \n\nI think I'll go with 3 9s. Because 9 is the highest digit, so it's harder for the opponent to raise the digit. They can only go higher in quantity. Since I have two 9s, it's plausible that the opponent has one. \n\nSo my bid would be \"BID: 3 9s\". \n\nWait, but in my hand I have two 9s. So the bid is 3, which requires at least one more. The opponent has 8 digits. The chance that they have at least one 9 is possible, but maybe not certain. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with 2 9s. That's exactly what I have. But then the opponent can raise to 3 9s easily. \n\nHmm. Maybe starting with 3 9s is better, as it's a higher bid and uses the highest possible digit. So I'll go with that. \n\nSo the action is BID: 3 9s. The reasoning is that I have two 9s, so bidding 3 gives a plausible claim that the opponent has at least one more, and using the highest digit (9) makes it harder for them to increase the digit further."
