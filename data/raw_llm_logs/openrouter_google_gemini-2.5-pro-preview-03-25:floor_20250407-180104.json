For the bid to be true, the opponent needs at least one 9 in their 8-digit hand. This is statistically quite likely. Challenging seems risky. I have three 1s in my hand. Bidding '3 1s' is a valid higher bid (increasing the quantity from 2 to 3). Since I hold all three 1s required for this bid, it's a very safe bid for me and puts pressure on the opponent. It's much safer than challenging the plausible '2 9s' bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 1s\"\n}\n```",
