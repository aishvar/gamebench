        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 1s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

                    "reasoning": "\nAlright, let's break this down. I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn. The current bid is 2 1s from Player 0. My hand is 57802098, which I can examine to see if I have any 1s. Looking at my digits: 5,7,8,0,2,0,9,8. No 1s there. \n\nSince I don't have any 1s, I need to consider whether the total number of 1s across both players could be higher than 2. The maximum possible is 16, but that's if every digit was a 1, which isn't the case here. \n\nPlayer 0 has 8 digits, and I have 8 as well. If Player 0 has 2 1s, that's possible, but I have none. So the total would be 2. But the bid is 2, so is that a valid bid? Wait, the rules say the bid is a claim that at least that many exist. So if the total is exactly 2, the bid is valid. \n\nBut maybe Player 0 is bluffing. They might have fewer than 2, or maybe none. If I challenge, and the total is less than 2, I win. But if it's exactly 2, they win. \n\nGiven that I have no 1s, the chance that the total is more than 2 is low. Player 0 could have 2, but I don't know. However, considering the risk, challenging might be a good move because if they're lying, I can win. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid higher, but since I don't have any 1s, it's risky to go higher without knowing Player 0's hand. Maybe bidding on another digit I have more of would be safer, but the rules require the bid to be higher than the current one. \n\nLooking at the digits I have, maybe I can bid on 0s. I have two 0s. The current bid is 2 1s. Bidding 2 0s wouldn't be higher because the quantity is the same but the digit is lower. So I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. \n\nIf I bid 3 0s, that would be higher in quantity. But I only have two 0s, so I'm not sure if that's a good idea. Alternatively, I could bid 2 2s, which is higher in digit. I have one 2 in my hand. \n\nBut considering the current bid is 2 1s, and I don't have any 1s, challenging seems like a viable option. The risk is that if Player 0 actually has 2 1s, I lose. But if they don't, I win. \n\nI think the best move here is to challenge the current bid. It's a calculated risk given that I don't have any 1s and the likelihood that the total is exactly 2 is uncertain.\n"
