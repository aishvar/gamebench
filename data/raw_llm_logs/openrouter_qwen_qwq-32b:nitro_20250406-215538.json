You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to decide whether to bid higher than the current 4 6s or challenge it. First, my hand is 87466231. Let me check the digits here. Breaking it down: 8,7,4,6,6,2,3,1. So looking for 6s in my hand, there are two 6s. The current bid is 4 6s from Player 0. Since I only have two, maybe the total is less? But I don't know what Player 0 has.\n\nThe previous bids were Player 0 started with 3 3s, then Player 1 went to 3 6s, then Player 0 upped to 4 6s. Now it's my turn as Player 1. To bid higher, I need either a higher quantity (like 5 6s) or same quantity with a higher digit. Let's think: If I go for 4 7s, that's higher digit. Do I have any 7s? My hand has one 7. But the current bid is 4 6s. If I bid 4 7s, that's a valid higher bid since 7 is higher than 6. Alternatively, maybe a higher quantity? Like 5 of any digit. Let's see possible digits. \n\nWhat other digits do I have? My hand has 8,7,4,6,6,2,3,1. The digits present are 1,2,3,4,6,7,8. So, maybe check if any digit could have a higher count. The current bid is 4 6s. If I can't find a digit where the total (mine plus theirs) could realistically reach 5 or higher, maybe challenging is better. \n\nWait, the maximum possible for any digit is 16, but since each has 8 digits, total is 16. The bid is 4 6s. If I think the actual count is less, challenge. But I have two 6s. If the opponent has two, that's four exactly. If they have three, that's five. Hmm. Since Player 0 raised to 4 after Player 1's 3 6s, maybe they have some 6s? If I have two, and they have two, that's four, so their bid is exactly correct. But if they have more, then it's higher. \n\nAlternatively, if I challenge, and the total is exactly 4, then I lose. If it's 3 or less, I win. But since they raised from 3 to 4, maybe they have confidence. Maybe safer to bid higher. Let's see. My hand has two 6s, so if I bid 4 7s, I have one 7. Maybe the opponent might not have many 7s. Alternatively, maybe bid a different digit. Let's see, what's the highest digit I can use. The highest digit I have is 8. If I bid 4 8s, but I only have one 8. So the total would be at most 1 plus whatever the opponent has. Unless they have three 8s, but that's unlikely. So that might be a bad bid. \n\nAlternatively, what about a higher quantity? To go to 5, maybe a digit that I have multiple of. The digits I have counts: \n\nDigits in my hand:\n- 6: 2\n- 8,7,4,2,3,1: 1 each.\n\nSo the only digits with multiple are 6 (2) and others are single. So if I want to bid a higher quantity, maybe 5 of a digit. But unless I can assume the opponent has some. Let's see, if I bid 5 6s, that would require my two plus their three. Maybe possible? But maybe risky. Alternatively, maybe go for a higher digit with same quantity. Like 4 7s. Since 7 is higher than 6. \n\nSo the bid would be \"BID: 4 7s\". That's valid because same quantity but higher digit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 4 8s? But 8 is higher than 7, but same logic. But with only one 8, maybe that's a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 5 of a lower digit but higher quantity. Like 5 2s? But I have one 2. Unless the opponent has four, which is possible but maybe unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, the safest bid might be to go to a higher digit with same quantity. 4 7s. \n\nAlternatively, challenging. If I think the total 6s are less than 4. Since I have two, opponent might have two, making it exactly 4. Then challenging would lose. But maybe they have only one, making total 3. Then challenge would win. But it's a gamble. \n\nHmm. The previous bid was 3 6s from Player 1 (me?), then Player 0 went to 4. Since I had two 6s, my initial bid was 3 6s. That would mean I was assuming at least one more 6 from the opponent. Now they bid 4, so they might have two 6s. So total would be four. If that's the case, challenging would lose. So better to bid higher. \n\nTherefore, the best move is to bid 4 7s, since it's a higher digit with same quantity, and I have at least one 7. That seems safer than challenging, which could lose if the total 6s are exactly 4. So the action should be BID:4 7s."
