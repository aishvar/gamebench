        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let's see, I'm Player 0, and it's my turn. The current bid is None, which means I have to make the first bid. \n\nLooking at my hand, the digits are 2,5,8,9,4,7,3,0. Hmm, let me count each digit. I have one 0, one 2, one 3, one 4, one 5, one 7, one 8, and one 9. So each digit appears exactly once in my hand. \n\nSince it's the first bid, I need to decide on a quantity and a digit that I think is likely to be present across both players' hands. But wait, I don't know what the other player has. So I have to make an educated guess based on my own hand.\n\nI remember that in Liar's Poker, the total possible digits are 16 (8 each from two players). So for any digit, the maximum possible count is 16. But since I only have one of each digit, I can't be sure about the other player's digits.\n\nI think I should start with a low bid to minimize the risk, especially since I'm the first to bid. Maybe a bid of 2 of a digit that I have. Let me look at my digits again. I have 0,2,3,4,5,7,8,9. Let's pick a digit that I have, say 5. I have one 5, so if the other player has at least one 5, the total would be 2. \n\nSo I'll bid 2 5s. That seems reasonable because it's a low bid, and I have some confidence that the other player might have a 5. Plus, if they don't, I can challenge later if needed. \n\nI could also consider other digits, but since I have all digits appearing once, starting with 2 of any might be a good strategy. I think 5 is a good choice because it's in the middle of the digit range, so it might not be too obvious. \n\nSo, I'll go with BID: 2 5s. That way, I'm making a low bid that's plausible, and it gives me a good starting point for the game.\n"
