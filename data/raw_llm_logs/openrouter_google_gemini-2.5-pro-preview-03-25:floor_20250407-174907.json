For the bid to be true, Player 1 must have at least three 6s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of a player having three or more of a specific digit (like 6) in an 8-digit hand is statistically low (around 3.8% calculated using binomial probability). Since I hold none of the bid digit, the entire quantity must be in the opponent's hand, making the bid highly unlikely. My previous bid was '2 3s', which was based on the two 3s in my hand. Player 1's jump to '3 6s' seems aggressive and potentially a bluff, especially since it requires a relatively high concentration of a single digit in their hand alone. While I could bid higher, for example '4 3s' (I have two 3s, needing two from the opponent - ~18.7% probability) or '3 7s'/'3 8s' (I have one, needing two from opponent - ~18.7% probability), challenging the current unlikely bid seems like the strongest statistical play.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\n```",
