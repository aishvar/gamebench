This bid claims there are at least five '3's in total across both players' 16 digits. Since I have one '3', this requires Player 0 to possess at least four '3's in their 8-digit hand. The probability of having four or more of a specific digit (like '3') in an 8-digit hand, assuming random distribution (p=0.1), is statistically very low (approximately 0.5%). Given this low probability, the bid '5 3s' is highly likely to be an exaggeration or a bluff. Therefore, challenging the bid is the most strategically sound action.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\n```",
