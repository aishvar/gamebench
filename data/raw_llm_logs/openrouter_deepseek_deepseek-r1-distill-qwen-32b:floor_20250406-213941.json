        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 8s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

                    "reasoning": "\nOkay, I need to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nSo, I'm Player 0, and it's my turn. The current bid is 3 8s made by Player 1. The bid history shows that I previously bid 3 5s, and then Player 1 responded with 3 8s. \n\nLooking at my hand, which is 78425156, I can count the digits I have. Let me list them out: 7, 8, 4, 2, 5, 1, 5, 6. So, I have two 5s in my hand. \n\nNow, the rules say that each player has 8 digits, so combined, there are 16 digits in total. The current bid is 3 8s, which means Player 1 is claiming that there are at least three 8s across both hands. \n\nI have an 8 in my hand, so that's one. Player 1 might have some 8s as well, but I don't know for sure. The maximum possible 8s is 16, but that's extremely unlikely. \n\nI need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge. If I bid, it has to be a higher quantity or same quantity with a higher digit. The last bid was 3 8s, so I could bid 4 8s or 3 9s, for example. \n\nBut considering the total digits, 3 8s seems plausible. If I challenge, and it turns out there are at least three 8s, I lose. If there are fewer, I win. \n\nI have one 8, so the total could be 1, 2, or more. It's possible that Player 1 has two 8s, making the total three. Alternatively, maybe they don't have any, making the total just one. \n\nGiven that Player 1 bid 3 8s, they might be bluffing. But without more information, it's hard to tell. Since I have a low number of 8s myself, challenging might be a good move to test their claim.\n\nSo, I think I'll challenge the bid. If they're wrong, I win. If they're right, I lose, but given the uncertainty, challenging seems like a strategic choice here.\n"
