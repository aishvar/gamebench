        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '7 6s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

The total count of 6s across both hands must be at least 7 (since Player 0 made the bid). Given that I have one 6, Player 0 must have at least 6 more 6s. The bid of 7 6s is already quite high. I need to decide whether to challenge or bid higher. To bid higher, I can either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit. Increasing the quantity to 8 with any digit is a possibility. However, considering my hand, I see that I have a 9, which is the highest digit. Bidding 7 9s would be a higher bid than 7 6s because 9 is greater than 6. I will analyze the likelihood of the count of 9s. I have one 9, so for 7 9s to be valid, Player 0 must have at least 6 more 9s. This seems unlikely since my hand is quite diverse and doesn't suggest that Player 0 has an unusually high count of 9s. However, it's still possible. I'll take a strategic decision based on the information available.\", \"action\": \"BID: 7 9s\"}",
