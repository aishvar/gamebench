Since the total digits are 16, for the bid of 3 twos to be valid, the opponent only needs to have at least one '2'. This is quite plausible. Therefore, challenging now is risky. A safe strategic move is to increase the bid slightly. I could either increase the quantity to 4 twos or bid at least 3 threes. Since I don't have any '3's, bidding on '3's is risky. However, I do have two '5's, so bidding 3 fives is reasonable because my hand alone contains two, and the opponent likely has at least one. This keeps pressure on the opponent with a plausible bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 5s\"\n}",
