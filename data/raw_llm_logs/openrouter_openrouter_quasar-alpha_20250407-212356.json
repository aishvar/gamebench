Since I have none, for the bid to be true, all '2's must be in Player 0's hand. While it's possible Player 0 has one or more '2's, a bid of 1 is very safe and likely true. Challenging now would be premature. The minimum valid raise is either increasing the quantity (to 2 2s), or bidding 1 of a higher digit (e.g., 1 3s). Since I have two '4's, bidding 2 4s is a strong move because I personally hold two, making it very probable. This puts pressure on Player 0 to challenge or raise with less certainty.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 4s\"\n}",
