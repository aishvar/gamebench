        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 4s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s.

Since I don't have any 4s, I must rely on the possibility that Player 1 has at least three 4s or that there's a distribution that allows for this bid to be true. However, without seeing Player 1's hand, it's hard to assess the likelihood. Given my hand and the goal to make a higher bid, I could consider bidding on a digit I have in abundance or try to challenge if I think the current bid is unlikely. Considering the digits I have, bidding on 3s is not an option since the current bid is already higher than 3s. I could try to bid on 6s, but I only have two, so bidding on 6s would require Player 1 to also have at least one 6 for a total of 3 or more, which seems speculative. Given these considerations and the fact that I don't have a strong basis to make a significantly higher bid with confidence, challenging the current bid might be a safer option if I believe it's unlikely. However, since I don't have enough information to confidently challenge and considering the rules require a strictly higher bid, I will choose to make a bid based on the digits I have, focusing on increasing the quantity or the digit value. Since I have more 3s than any other digit besides none, and the current bid is for 4s, I should look for a digit that could reasonably have a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. Given my lack of 4s and higher digits in significant quantities, the best strategy seems to be to increase the quantity of a digit that I can somewhat control or guess. But since my hand doesn't strongly support bidding on any specific higher digit with confidence, and given the current bid of 3 4s, I must decide whether to challenge or find a plausible next bid. Without strong evidence to challenge and given the need for a higher bid, I'll consider what's plausible given typical distributions and my hand. Since I don't have enough of any single digit to confidently bid higher on that digit alone and considering the current bid, a reasonable approach might be to consider the total distribution and possible bids that could logically follow, taking into account the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and the current bid is relatively low.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 3s\"\n}",
