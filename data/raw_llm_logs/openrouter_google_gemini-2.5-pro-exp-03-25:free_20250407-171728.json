I need to make a higher bid or challenge.\\n\\n1.  **Challenge Assessment:** The bid '2 6s' claims there are at least two 6s in total. I have one 6 in my hand. For the bid to be true, Player 0 only needs to have one 6 in their 8 digits. This is highly probable, making a challenge very risky.\\n\\n2.  **Bidding Options:** I need to bid higher than '2 6s', either by increasing the quantity (to 3 or more 6s) or by increasing the digit (to 7s, 8s, 9s, or 0s).\\n    *   Bidding '3 6s': I have one 6. This bid requires Player 0 to have at least two 6s. Possible, but less certain.\\n    *   Bidding on 7s: I have two 7s. A bid of '1 7s' or '2 7s' is safe but low. A bid of '3 7s' is a valid higher bid (digit 7 > 6). It claims at least three 7s total. Since I have two, it relies on Player 0 having at least one 7, which is statistically likely.\\n    *   Bidding on other digits: Bidding on 5s or 2s requires a quantity of at least 3, but these digits are lower than 6, making bids like '3 5s' or '3 2s' invalid. Bidding on 8s, 9s, or 0s would be a bluff as I have none.\\n\\n3.  **Decision:** Comparing '3 6s' and '3 7s', the bid '3 7s' is statistically safer because it only requires Player 0 to have one 7 (which is likely), whereas '3 6s' requires Player 0 to have two 6s. Bidding '3 7s' leverages my strong holding of two 7s and makes a reasonably aggressive, likely true statement.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 7s\"\n}\n```",
