        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 6s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

                    "reasoning": "\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nSo, it's my turn as Player 1. The current bid is 3 6s made by Player 0. My hand is 49219857. Let me look at the digits I have: 4,9,2,1,9,8,5,7. Hmm, I don't see any 6s in my hand. That's interesting.\n\nThe rules say that each player has 8 digits, so there are 16 digits in total. The last bid was 3 6s. I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge that bid.\n\nSince I don't have any 6s, I wonder how many 6s Player 0 might have. They could have some, but it's also possible they're bluffing. If I challenge, the actual count of 6s will be revealed. If there are fewer than 3, I win. If there are 3 or more, Player 0 wins.\n\nBut wait, the maximum possible 6s is 16. Since I have none, the other player could have up to 8. But it's unlikely they have 3 or more unless they're really confident.\n\nConsidering that, challenging seems like a good move because the bid is 3 6s and I don't have any. It's a bit risky, but given the information, it might be worth it to see if Player 0 is lying.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to make a higher bid. To do that, I need to increase the quantity or the digit. The current bid is 3 6s. So a higher bid could be 4 6s or 3 7s, etc. But I don't have any 6s, so if I bid 4 6s, I'm relying on Player 0 having enough. But if I challenge and win, I get a point.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the probabilities. If there are 3 6s, that means Player 0 has all of them since I have none. That's possible, but maybe unlikely. It's a 50% chance if they have 3, but I don't know.\n\nGiven that, challenging might be the better option because if they're lying, I win. If they're telling the truth, I lose. But I don't have any 6s, so it's a 50-50 chance, but maybe it's worth taking.\n\nSo, I think the best move is to challenge the bid.\n"
