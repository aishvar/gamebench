You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to make the first bid in this Liar's Poker game. My hand is 64974278. Let me count how many of each digit I have.\n\nLooking at my hand: 6, 4, 9, 7, 4, 2, 7, 8. So breaking that down:\n\n- 4: 2\n- 6: 1\n- 7: 2\n- 2: 1\n- 8: 1\n- 9: 1\n\nSo the digits 4 and 7 each appear twice in my hand. The others are single. Since the current bid is None, I can start with any valid bid. The goal is to set a bid that's not too high but also not too easy to challenge. Since there are 16 digits total (8 per player), but the opponent's hand is unknown.\n\nStarting with my strongest digits. The 4s and 7s are two each. If I bid on 4s, maybe start with a quantity that's half of what I have plus some. But wait, the first bid can be as low as possible. But since there's no previous bid, I need to make a bid that's a good starting point. Typically, players might start with a bid that's half their own count plus a small number. For example, if I have two 4s, maybe bid 3 or 4, considering the opponent might have at least one. But since the total possible is up to 16, but the first bid should be safe.\n\nWait, but the opponent has 8 digits. If I have two 4s, the opponent could have 0 to 6 more 4s. So the total possible 4s could be up to 8 (if opponent has 6, which is unlikely). But realistically, maybe they have 1 or 2. So total 4s could be 3 or 4. If I bid 3 4s, that's possible. But since I have two, I can be somewhat confident. Alternatively, maybe start with a lower digit but higher quantity. Wait, but the first bid has to be a quantity and digit. Let's think of the optimal starting bid.\n\nAnother approach: the sum of all digits in my hand is 8, and the opponent has 8, so total 16. The average count for each digit would be 1.6 (since 16 digits / 10 possible digits). But some digits are more common. Since I have two 4s and two 7s, maybe those are better to bid on. Let's say I bid 3 4s. That means I think there are at least three 4s in total. Since I have two, the opponent needs at least one. The chance that the opponent has at least one 4 is... Well, there are 8 unknown digits. The probability that none of them are 4 is (8/10)^8, which is low. So maybe 3 4s is a safe bid. Alternatively, 4 7s. Wait, I have two 7s. Bidding 4 would mean the opponent has at least two. That's riskier. So maybe 3 4s is safer. Alternatively, maybe 2 of a higher digit. Since the bid can be higher in digit if quantity is same. For example, if I bid 2 7s, that's same quantity as 2 4s, but higher digit. But since the current bid is None, I can start with any. So maybe start with a higher digit to make it harder for the opponent to raise. For example, bidding 2 9s. But I only have one 9. The opponent might have none, so total is 1. That's risky. Alternatively, 2 8s. I have one 8. So total could be 1 or more. But same problem. So safer to stick with digits I have more of.\n\nSo the best options are 4s and 7s. Let's say I go with 4s. Bidding 3 4s. That's a reasonable start. Alternatively, 2 7s. But since 7 is a higher digit than 4, maybe that's better. Wait, the bid structure: if I bid 2 7s, the next player has to bid higher. They can either bid 3 of any digit (including lower ones) or 2 of a higher digit. So if I bid 2 7s, the next player could bid 2 8s, 2 9s, or 3 of any digit. If I bid 3 4s, the next player can bid 3 of a higher digit or 4 of any. So maybe starting with a higher digit in the same quantity makes it harder for the opponent to bid higher without increasing the quantity. So maybe starting with 2 9s. Wait, but I have only one 9. If I bid 2 9s, the opponent needs to have at least one. If they have none, then total is 1, which is less than 2, so if they challenge, I lose. But since it's the first bid, maybe they won't challenge immediately. But it's risky. So maybe safer to bid based on the digits I have more of. So 2 4s or 2 7s. But since 7 is higher, maybe 2 7s is better. Let me check. If I bid 2 7s, and the opponent has, say, one 7, then total is 3, which meets the bid. If they have none, total is 2, which exactly meets. Wait, the bid is \"at least\", so if I bid 2 7s and total is 2, that's still valid. But if I have two, then opponent has zero, total is two. So my bid is valid. Therefore, bidding 2 7s is safe because even if the opponent has none, the total is 2, which meets the bid. Wait, but I have two 7s. So regardless of the opponent's hand, the total is at least two. Therefore, bidding 2 7s is a guaranteed valid bid. That's a smart move. Because the opponent can't challenge it, since I already have two. So the minimum total is two. Therefore, if I bid 2 7s, the bid is safe. Then the opponent has to either bid higher or challenge. If they challenge, they lose because there are at least two 7s. So that's a safe opening bid. That's better. So the action should be \"BID: 2 7s\". Because I have two 7s, so the total is at least two. Therefore, the bid is safe. That's a solid opening move.\n"
