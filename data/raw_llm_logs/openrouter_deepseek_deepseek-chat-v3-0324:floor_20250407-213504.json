There are no 3s in my hand, so the opponent's bid of 3 3s means they must have at least three 3s in their hand. Since the maximum possible quantity is 16 (8 per player), it's still possible for the opponent to have three 3s, but it's a relatively high bid given that 3s are not particularly common digits. However, since I don't have any 3s, I can't be certain they are bluffing. A safer move would be to bid a higher quantity of a digit I have more of, such as 0s or 9s. I have two 0s, so a bid of 4 0s would be a reasonable next move, as it's higher in quantity than the current bid and likely safe given my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 0s\"\n}\n```",
