        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

                    "reasoning": "\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by looking at the rules and the current state of the game.\n\nSo, each player has 8 secret digits, and we take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit across both hands. The bid has to be strictly higher than the previous one, either by quantity or digit. If I can't make a higher bid, I can challenge the last bid.\n\nIn this case, the current bid is 'None', which means I'm the first to bid. My hand is 85919273. Let me count the digits I have:\n\n- 8: appears once\n- 5: once\n- 9: twice\n- 1: once\n- 2: once\n- 7: once\n- 3: once\n\nSo, the digit that appears the most in my hand is 9, with two occurrences. But since I'm the first to bid, I can choose any digit and quantity. My goal is to make a bid that's likely to be true but also gives me a strategic advantage.\n\nSince I have two 9s, I might consider bidding 2 9s. But wait, the bid has to be strictly higher than the previous. Since there's no previous bid, I can choose any quantity and digit. However, I should aim to make a bid that's hard for the opponent to beat, but also believable.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the distribution of digits. Since each player has 8 digits, the total across both hands is 16 digits. If I bid 2 9s, the opponent might think it's too low and try to bid higher. But maybe I can set a trap by starting low.\n\nBut wait, as the first player, I want to set a baseline that's challenging but not impossible. Let me think about the possible digits. If I choose a higher digit, like 8 or 9, it might be less common, but I have two 9s, so maybe that's a good starting point.\n\nAlternatively, if I choose a lower digit, like 3, with only one occurrence, but maybe the opponent has more. But since I have two 9s, it's safer to base my bid on that.\n\nSo, I'll go with 2 9s. That seems reasonable because I have two, and the opponent might not have many, making it a good starting point.\n"
