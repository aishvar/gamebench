The current bid is 3 1s, so for that bid to be valid, the opponent must have at least one 1. While it's plausible they might have one or more 1s in their eight digits, the probability that they have at least one is fairly high, making a challenge risky. Instead of challenging, I should make a higher, safe bid. Looking at my hand, I have two 9s as well, so bidding 3 9s is equally risky. However, I also have two 5s, but no digit appears more than twice in my hand. To safely increase the bid, I'll choose a digit where I have two and assume the opponent has at least one, making 3 likely. Alternatively, I can increase the quantity to 4 for any digit, but that's riskier. A safer move is to bid 3 5s, which is a valid higher bid (since digit is higher than 1).\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 5s\"\n}",
