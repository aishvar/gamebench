        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 5s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Player 1 suggests there are at least two more '5s' between their eight digits. Without additional information, it's plausible that Player 1 has at least two '5s'. Given the uncertainty and the relatively low bid, challenging would be risky. I should instead raise the bid slightly. My hand has two '4s', making it reasonable to bid on '4s'. The previous bid was '2 4s', so I'll increase the quantity to '3 4s', which is strictly higher than the current bid of '3 5s' due to moving up in digit value or quantity. However, '3 4s' would not be a valid bid since it's lower in digit value than '3 5s'. Thus, I must bid either '3 6s' or increase the quantity. Since I have two '0s', bidding '4 0s' seems reasonable, as I already hold two and would only need two more from Player 1's hand, which is plausible.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 0s\"\n}",
