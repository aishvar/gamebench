        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 3 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '4 6s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 24 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.",

                    "content": "To determine the best course of action, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Your Hand**: 82890014\n   - Breaking down your hand: You have 2 eights, 1 two, 1 four, 1 zero, 1 nine. The digits and their counts are as follows: 0 (1), 1 (0), 2 (1), 3 (0), 4 (1), 5 (0), 6 (0), 7 (0), 8 (2), 9 (1).\n\n2. **Current Bid**: 4 6s\n   - The current bid is on the quantity of 6s, stating there are at least 4 sixes in total across all players.\n\n3. **Your Observation**:\n   - You have no 6s in your hand. This means that the 4 6s bid is entirely based on the other two players' hands.\n\n4. **Analysis**:\n   - Since you have no 6s, the total count of 6s across the other two players must be at least 4 for the current bid to be valid.\n   - Given that each player has 8 digits, and there are 3 players, the total number of digits is 24. The maximum possible count for any digit (including 6) is 24.\n   - The probability that two players collectively have at least 4 sixes can be considered. However, without knowing the other players' hands, we must rely on the bidding history and our hand.\n\n5. **Bidding History**:\n   - The bid history shows a progression from 3 2s to 4 2s and then to 4 6s, indicating an escalation in bids.\n   - The fact that the bid moved from 3 7s to 4 2s and then to 4 6s suggests that players are trying to outbid each other with a higher quantity or a higher digit.\n\n6. **Decision Making**:\n   - To make a higher bid than 4 6s, you need to either bid the same quantity (4) with a higher digit or a higher quantity with the same or any digit.\n   - The next higher digit than 6 is 7, 8, or 9. You can bid 4 7s, 4 8s, or 4 9s. \n   - You have 2 eights, which is a relatively strong presence of a digit in your hand. Bidding 4 8s seems plausible because it involves a higher digit (8 > 6), and you have some 8s.\n\n7. **Action**:\n   - Bidding 4 8s: You have 2 eights, so it's conceivable that the other two players together have at least 2 more eights, making 4 eights in total plausible.\n   - Challenging 4 6s: Since you don't have any 6s, and it's possible for the other two players to have a total of 4 sixes between them, challenging might not be the strongest action unless you believe the bid is highly improbable.\n\nGiven the information and the need to make a decision, let's consider the options:\n- **Bidding 4 8s**: This is a valid higher bid because 8 is greater than 6. You have 2 eights, so it's reasonable to believe the total count could be 4 or more.\n- **Challenging**: Without strong evidence that 4 6s is an overbid (and given that you don't have any 6s), challenging might be risky.\n\nHere's my response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have 2 eights in my hand. The current bid is 4 6s. I can make a higher bid by increasing the digit. Bidding 4 8s is a reasonable action as it is a higher bid and I have some eights in my hand, making it plausible that the total count could be 4 or more.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 8s\"\n}\n```",
