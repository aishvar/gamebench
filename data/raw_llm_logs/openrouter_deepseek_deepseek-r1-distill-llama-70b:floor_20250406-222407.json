        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation. \n\nFirst, the game is between two players, each with 8 secret digits. My hand is 61429378. I need to make a bid or challenge, but since the current bid is None, I have to make the first bid. \n\nLooking at my hand, I should count how many of each digit I have. Let's list them out: 6, 1, 4, 2, 9, 3, 7, 8. So, each digit appears once. That means I don't have any duplicates. \n\nSince I don't have any duplicates, the highest quantity I can bid for any digit is 1. But wait, in Liar's Poker, the bid has to be at least a certain quantity of a specific digit across both players' hands. So if I bid 1 of a digit, the opponent could potentially have none, making the total 1, which would make my bid valid. But since I'm starting the bid, I want to choose a digit that I think is likely to have at least that quantity in total.\n\nLooking at my digits, I have a 9. Bidding 1 9s seems safe because I have one, and the opponent might have another. Alternatively, I could bid 1 on any of my other digits. But 9 is a high digit, so if I bid 1 9s, it's a good starting point because it's a strong digit and might make the opponent think twice about challenging.\n\nI should also consider the possible maximum. Since each player has 8 digits, the maximum any digit can have is 16. But that's not relevant here since I'm starting with a low bid.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think bidding 1 9s is a solid move. It's a reasonable starting point, and since I have one, I'm confident the total is at least one. Plus, it's a high digit, which might give me an advantage if the opponent decides to challenge or raise the bid.\n"
