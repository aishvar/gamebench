        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 9s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

I have one 9 in my hand (80668492), and since there are two players with 8 digits each, the total count of 9s could be anywhere from 1 (if the other player has none) to 2 (if the other player has one 9). Bidding higher than 3 9s requires either increasing the quantity or the digit. Increasing the digit is not possible since it's already 9. So, I need to increase the quantity to 4. Given that the maximum possible count for any digit is 16 and we are starting with 8 digits each, a bid of 4 for any digit is plausible. Since I have one 9, bidding 4 9s implies the other player has at least 3 nines, which is possible but unlikely. However, I can bid 4 0s, increasing the quantity and changing the digit to the lowest possible, which is a relatively safe move as it changes the digit and is not directly related to my hand's strength on 9s. My hand has one 8 and no 9s were visible in my last bid's context, but I do have a zero. The safer and more strategic move seems to be to bid 4 0s.\", \"action\": \"BID: 4 0s\"}",
