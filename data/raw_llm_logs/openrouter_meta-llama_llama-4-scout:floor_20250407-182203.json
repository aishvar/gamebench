To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one '5', bidding a higher quantity than 2 is not possible for me with the digit '5'. I should bid a higher digit or challenge if I think '2 5s' is unlikely. Given that the maximum possible quantity is 16 and I have 8 digits, I can try to bid a higher digit if I have multiple instances of it. In my hand, I have two '0's, two '4's, and one of each of the other digits. The highest digit I can bid that is higher than '5' and exists in my hand is '6' or higher if I have it. I have one '6'. I can bid '1 6s' as it's a higher digit than '5'.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: Q D\"\n}\n```",
