        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 7s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let's see the situation. My hand is 30171431. So, let me count the digits I have. Breaking it down: 3, 0, 1, 7, 1, 4, 3, 1. So, I have two 3s, one 0, two 1s, one 7, one 4, and the rest are 1s again. Wait, no, let me recount: 3 appears twice, 0 once, 1 three times, 7 once, 4 once. So, digits in my hand: 3,3,0,1,1,1,7,4.\n\nThe current bid is 3 7s, made by Player 0. The bid history shows that the bidding started with 2 2s, then 2 3s, 2 4s, 3 4s, and now 3 7s.\n\nMy goal is to either make a higher bid or challenge the current bid. So, I need to think about what's likely given the current state.\n\nFirst, let's consider the current bid: 3 7s. That means Player 0 is claiming there are at least three 7s across both hands. My hand has one 7. So, the total number of 7s is either one (if Player 0 doesn't have any) or more. But Player 0's bid is 3, so they must think there are at least three.\n\nNow, I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge. Let's think about possible higher bids. The next bid could be a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. So, for example, 4 7s would be higher in quantity, or 3 8s would be higher in digit.\n\nBut I don't have any 8s in my hand. So, if I bid 3 8s, I'm assuming that Player 0 has enough 8s to make it three. But I don't know their hand. Alternatively, I could bid 4 7s, but I only have one 7. So, unless Player 0 has three 7s, which seems unlikely, that might be a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can bid on a different digit. Let's see what digits are possible. The current bid is 3 7s. So, the next bid could be 3 8s, 3 9s, or 4 7s, etc.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 3s. Maybe I could bid 4 3s, but I only have two. So, unless Player 0 has two 3s, that would make four total. But I don't know their hand. Alternatively, I could bid 3 4s, but the bid history shows that Player 1 previously bid 3 4s, and Player 0 responded with 3 7s. So, maybe 4s are less likely now.\n\nAlternatively, considering the digits I have, maybe I can bid on 1s. I have three 1s. So, maybe bid 4 1s. But I don't know how many 1s Player 0 has. If they have one, then total would be four. If they have none, then it's three. So, maybe that's a possibility.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best move. Alternatively, maybe challenging is better. Let's think about the likelihood of there being three 7s. I have one, so Player 0 would need to have two. Is that likely? Well, in the previous bids, Player 0 bid 3 7s, which is a significant claim. Maybe they're bluffing.\n\nAlternatively, considering the maximum possible quantity is 16, but that's across all digits. For a specific digit, the maximum is 8 per player, so 16 total. But for 7s, it's possible that there are three. However, given that I only have one, the chance that Player 0 has two is possible but not certain.\n\nBut wait, let's think about the bidding history. The previous bids were 2 2s, 2 3s, 2 4s, 3 4s, and now 3 7s. So, each time, the bids are increasing either in quantity or digit. Player 0 is escalating, which might indicate they have a strong hand or are trying to bluff.\n\nGiven that, maybe challenging is a good option. If I challenge, and the actual count is less than three, I win. If it's three or more, Player 0 wins.\n\nBut I have to consider the likelihood. I have one 7. If Player 0 has two, then total is three. If they have one, total is two. If they have none, total is one.\n\nSo, the chance that there are three 7s is only possible if Player 0 has two. But without knowing their hand, it's a gamble. However, given that the current bid is 3 7s, and I have limited information, challenging might be a strategic move, especially if I think Player 0 is overestimating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can make a higher bid. For example, 3 8s. But I don't have any 8s, so I'm assuming Player 0 has three. That seems risky. Or 4 7s, but I only have one, so I'm assuming Player 0 has three, which is possible but uncertain.\n\nGiven that, challenging might be the better option, as it's a way to test the validity of the current bid without committing to a higher claim that I might not be able to back up.\n\nSo, my reasoning is that the current bid of 3 7s is risky because I only have one 7, and it's uncertain if Player 0 has enough. Challenging could reveal the true count and potentially win the round.\n"
