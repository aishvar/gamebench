For the bid of 4 9s to be true, Player 0 must have at least three 9s in their 8-digit hand. The probability of a player having three or more of a specific digit in an 8-digit hand is relatively low. Player 0 has escalated the bids on 9s (2 9s, 3 9s, 4 9s) after I bid other digits, but requiring three 9s from them seems like a stretch, especially given they are described as 'Naive 50/50' and might be bluffing or overbidding. My strongest digit is 8 (three 8s), but bidding 5 8s would require Player 0 to have two 8s, which is also uncertain, especially since they didn't challenge my previous 4 8s bid. Given the unlikelihood of Player 0 holding three 9s, challenging the current bid of 4 9s appears to be the most strategically sound move.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\n```",
