You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation. \n\nFirst, I know that in Liar's Poker, each player has 8 secret digits, and the goal is to make accurate bids on the total count of a specific digit across all players' hands. The bids can be challenged, and if someone challenges, we reveal the actual count to see if the bid was correct.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have the digits 8, 9, 6, 1, 0, 2, 1, 7. Let me list them out to get a clearer picture: 8, 9, 6, 1, 0, 2, 1, 7. So, I can count how many of each digit I have. \n\nStarting with 0s: I have one 0. 1s: I have two 1s. 2s: one 2. 6s: one 6. 7s: one 7. 8s: one 8. 9s: one 9. The other digits (3,4,5) are not present in my hand.\n\nSince the current bid is None, that means I'm the first to make a bid. I need to decide what to bid. I have to think about what digits I have and how likely it is that the opponent has those digits as well. \n\nI have two 1s. So, the total number of 1s could be two (if the opponent has none), or more if they have some. But considering that each player has 8 digits, the maximum possible for any digit is 16 (if both players have 8 of the same digit, which is impossible because there are only 10 digits). So, realistically, the maximum for any digit is 16, but practically, it's much lower.\n\nSince I'm the first to bid, I should make a bid that's reasonable but not too high, to avoid being challenged. I have two 1s, so perhaps I can bid on 1s. Maybe 2 1s. But wait, since I have two, the total could be two or more. But if I bid 2 1s, the opponent might have zero, making the total exactly two, which would make my bid valid. However, if the opponent has one or more, the total would be higher, which is also fine.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a digit I have only one of, but that might be riskier because the opponent might not have any, making the total just one. For example, if I bid on 0s as 1 0, that's possible, but if the opponent has none, it's exactly one. But if they have more, it's higher. But since I have only one, maybe it's safer to bid on a digit I have more of.\n\nAnother thought: since I have two 1s, maybe I can bid 3 1s. That way, if the opponent has at least one, the total is three or more. But if they have none, the total is two, which would make my bid invalid. So, that's a risk. Alternatively, I could bid 2 1s, which is safer because the total can't be less than two, as I already have two.\n\nWait, no. If I bid 2 1s, and the opponent has zero, the total is two, which meets the bid. If they have one, it's three, which is also fine. So, 2 1s is a safe bid because the minimum total is two, which I already have. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid higher on another digit. For example, I have one 8. If I bid 1 8, that's possible, but it's a low bid, and the next player might easily overbid. But since the current bid is None, I can choose any digit and quantity. \n\nAnother approach is to consider the distribution of digits. Since I have two 1s, and considering that in a random distribution, 1s might be more common, perhaps the opponent also has some. So, the total number of 1s could be higher. But I can't be certain. \n\nWait, but I should also think about the possible maximum. The total number of 1s can't exceed 16, but that's not helpful. More importantly, I should consider what's a reasonable bid that's likely to be true but not too obvious. \n\nIf I bid 2 1s, it's a low bid, and the opponent might challenge it because it's easy to have at least two 1s. Alternatively, they might overbid. But since it's the first bid, maybe starting with a lower bid is better to avoid an immediate challenge.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a higher digit that I have, like 8 or 9, but I only have one each. So, bidding 1 8 or 1 9. But that's a very low bid, and the opponent might challenge it, thinking that maybe there's only one. \n\nWait, but if I bid 1 8, and the opponent has none, then the total is one, which meets the bid. If they have one, it's two, which is also fine. So, 1 8 is a possible bid. But it's a low bid, and the opponent might choose to challenge it, thinking that perhaps there's only one or none.\n\nAlternatively, I could look for digits that are less likely to be bid on. For example, 0s are often less common, but I have one. So, bidding 1 0 might be possible, but again, it's a low bid.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the safest bet is to bid on the digit I have the most of, which is 1s, with a quantity of 2. So, I'll bid 2 1s. That way, I'm certain that the total is at least two, and possibly more if the opponent has any. This makes it a valid bid, and it's not too high to be immediately challenged. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 1s, hoping the opponent has at least one, but that's risky because if they have none, the bid fails. So, 2 1s is safer.\n\nAnother thought: maybe I should bid on a higher digit to set a higher bar. For example, I have one 9. If I bid 1 9, it's possible, but again, it's a low bid. The opponent might challenge, thinking that maybe there's only one or none. \n\nBut since I have two 1s, which is more than any other digit, I think it's better to bid on that. So, I'll go with 2 1s.\n"
