You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn to make a bid since the current bid is None. My hand is 36413069. Let me think about what I should do here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the rules properly. In Liar's Poker, each player has 8 secret digits, and we take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit across all players' hands. A bid has to be higher than the previous one, either by quantity or digit value. If someone challenges, we reveal the count, and the person who's right wins.\n\nSince the current bid is None, I get to start the bidding. I should look at my hand and see which digits I have and how many of each. Let's break down my hand: 3, 6, 4, 1, 3, 0, 6, 9. So, I have two 3s, two 6s, and one each of 4, 1, 0, and 9. \n\nI need to decide what to bid. I don't want to bid too high because the opponent might challenge me, and I don't have a lot of any single digit. My highest counts are two 3s and two 6s. \n\nConsidering that, maybe I can bid on 2 3s or 2 6s. But wait, since the current bid is None, I can start with any bid. However, starting too low might not be beneficial because the opponent can easily overbid me. On the other hand, starting too high could risk a challenge.\n\nLooking at my digits, 6 is a higher digit than 3, so maybe bidding 2 6s is a good start. It's a moderate bid, not too high, and since I have two of them, it's possible that the total across both hands could be two or more. Plus, 6 is a decently high digit, so it's harder for the opponent to overbid on the same quantity but a higher digit without having a strong hand.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider bidding 3 of a digit if I have at least one, but since I only have two of 3 and 6, that's not possible. So, sticking with 2 6s seems reasonable.\n\nI don't see a reason to challenge yet because there's no previous bid to challenge. So, I'll go ahead and bid 2 6s. It's a safe start, and it gives me a chance to see how the opponent reacts. If they challenge, and if the total is at least 2, I win. If not, I lose, but since I have two, the opponent would need at least zero more 6s, which is possible, but it's a manageable risk.\n"
