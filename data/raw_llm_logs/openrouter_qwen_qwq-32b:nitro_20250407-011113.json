        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let me think through this. So it's my first turn in Liar's Poker. My hand is 84853729. I need to make the first bid since the current bid is None. The rules say my bid has to be valid, but since there's nothing before, I just need to start with something.\n\nFirst, I should look at my own digits to see what I have. Let me list them out: 8, 4, 8, 5, 3, 7, 2, 9. Let's count each digit:\n\n- 8 appears twice (positions 1 and 3)\n- 4 once\n- 5 once\n- 3 once\n- 7 once\n- 2 once\n- 9 once\n\nSo the most frequent digit in my hand is 8 with two instances. Since I'm starting, maybe I can bid on the 8s. But wait, the bid has to consider both players' hands. The total digits are 16 (8 each). \n\nIf I bid 3 8s, that's claiming there are at least three 8s in total. Since I have two, the opponent could have one, which is possible. Alternatively, maybe I can bid higher on another digit? But my other digits only have one each. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a lower quantity but higher digit? Like 2 9s. But 2 9s might be too low to be interesting. Hmm. \n\nWait, the first bid can be anything, but it's better to start with a bid that's plausible but leaves room for others to raise. Since I have two 8s, maybe bidding 3 8s is a good start. That way, if the opponent doesn't have an 8, they might have to raise to a different digit. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 2 9s, someone might just go higher. But starting with 3 8s seems reasonable. Let me check: the minimum I can bid is 1 of any digit, but starting higher makes sense. Since it's the first bid, I need to set it. So I'll go with 3 8s. That uses my two 8s and assumes the opponent has at least one. Seems safe enough. \n\nI don't see a reason to challenge because there's no prior bid. So my action is to bid 3 8s."
