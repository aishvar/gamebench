        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 4s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the current bid is 2 4s, made by Player 0. My hand is 07274379. I need to decide whether to make a higher bid or challenge this bid.\n\nLooking at my hand: 0,7,2,7,4,3,7,9. Let me count how many of each digit I have. \n\n- 0: 1\n- 2: 1\n- 3: 1\n- 4: 1\n- 7: 3\n- 9: 1\n\nSo, I have one 4, which is relevant to the current bid. The current bid is 2 4s, meaning Player 0 is betting that there are at least two 4s in total between both players. Since I have one 4, Player 0 must have at least one 4 for their bid to be valid. But I don't know what their hand is.\n\nNow, I need to decide if I should challenge or bid higher. If I challenge, and the total number of 4s is less than 2, I win. If it's 2 or more, Player 0 wins. Since I have one 4, the only way the total is less than 2 is if Player 0 has zero 4s. But since they bid 2 4s, they probably have at least one, maybe two.\n\nAlternatively, I can make a higher bid. To make a higher bid than 2 4s, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Let's see my options.\n\nI have three 7s in my hand. So if I bid 3 7s, that would be a higher bid than 2 4s because the quantity is higher. Is that a good move? Well, I have three 7s, so the total could be three or more if Player 0 has any. But I don't know their hand.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid a higher digit with the same quantity, like 2 5s, but since I don't have any 5s, that might be risky. Similarly, 2 6s or higher digits are not in my hand, so I don't have information on those.\n\nSo, the safest higher bid I can make is 3 7s because I have three of them. This way, I'm using my own cards to back up the bid, which makes it more likely to be correct. Plus, it's a higher quantity than the current bid, which is good.\n\nI don't think challenging is the best move here because I don't have enough information about Player 0's 4s. They might have one or two, making the total 2 or 3, which would make their bid valid. So challenging could backfire.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with bidding 3 7s. It's a solid move based on my hand, and it's a higher bid than the current one.\n"
