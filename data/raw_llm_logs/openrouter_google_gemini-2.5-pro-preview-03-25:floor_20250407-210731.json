I need to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher one.\\n\\nTo evaluate the current bid (3 7s): I have one 7. For the bid to be true, Player 0 must have at least two 7s in their 8-digit hand. This is plausible, but not certain. Given Player 0 is 'Naive 50/50', their bidding might not be purely strategic, making a challenge a viable option.\\n\\nTo evaluate potential bids: I can bid higher by increasing the quantity or the digit. \\n- Bidding on quantity 4: My strongest quantity is three 8s. Bidding '4 8s' would require Player 0 to have at least one 8, which is statistically likely (expected value is 0.8 eights in their hand). This is a strong possibility.\\n- Bidding on quantity 3: I can bid '3 8s' or '3 9s'. \\n - '3 9s': I have one 9. This requires Player 0 to have at least two 9s. Less likely than the current bid being true.\\n - '3 8s': I have three 8s. This bid is true based on my hand alone, regardless of Player 0's hand. This is an extremely safe and strong bid.\\n\\nComparing options: Challenging '3 7s' is reasonable. Bidding '4 8s' is aggressive and likely true. Bidding '3 8s' is very safe and leverages my hand's strength effectively. It forces Player 0 to either challenge a bid that is almost certainly true or make a riskier higher bid (like 3 9s or 4 0s). Given the strength of holding three 8s, making the safe and informative bid of '3 8s' is the best strategic move.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 8s\"\n}\n```",
