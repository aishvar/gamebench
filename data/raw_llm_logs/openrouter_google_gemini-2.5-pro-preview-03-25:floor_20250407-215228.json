For this bid to be true, Player 0 must have at least four '0's in their 8-digit hand, as there are only 16 digits in total (8 per player). The statistical expectation for the number of '0's in Player 0's hand is 8 * (1/10) = 0.8. Requiring four '0's when the expectation is less than one, and I possess none, makes the bid highly suspect. Challenging seems statistically advantageous compared to making a higher bid, such as '4 1s' (requiring 3 ones from the opponent) or '4 4s' (requiring 2 fours from the opponent), which are also somewhat unlikely but less so than '4 0s'.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\n```",
