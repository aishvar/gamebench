Since I hold no zeros, the entire count of zeros depends solely on my opponent's hand. For the bid of 4 zeros to be true, the opponent would need to have all 4 or more zeros in their 8-digit hand, which is unlikely given typical digit distributions. Statistically, the expected number of zeros in an 8-digit hand is less than 1 (since zeros are uniformly distributed). Given this, the probability that the opponent has 4 or more zeros is quite low. Therefore, the bid of 4 zeros is likely an overstatement, and challenging it is the best move.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
