For Player 0's hand to make the bid valid, they would need at least two more 9s, totaling three. The probability of them holding two or more 9s in their eight digits is moderate but not guaranteed. Since three 9s across both hands is plausible but somewhat risky to challenge immediately, a safer strategic move is to increase the bid modestly. The best next bid is 3 tens (i.e., 3 zeros) or 4 of any digit. Since I have no 9s beyond the one, but I do have two 1s (digits: 1, 8, 5, 6, 9, 2, 1, 5), bidding 3 1s is equal, so I must increase quantity or digit. I have two 1s, so bidding 4 1s is a reasonable step. This bid is plausible, pressures the opponent, and avoids an immediate challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 1s\"\n}",
