        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 3 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '5 7s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 24 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

In my hand, I have 01030528, which contains: one 0, one 1, two 3s, one 5, one 8, and no 7s. The current bid is \\'5 7s\\'. Since I have zero 7s in my hand, there would need to be at least 5 7s between the other two players\\' hands. Each player has 8 digits, so there are 24 total digits in play. The probability of having 5 or more 7s when I have none is not extremely low, but it\\'s getting less likely as the bid increases. Looking at the bid history, Player 1 has been consistently raising, moving from 3 0s to 4 2s to 5 7s, which could indicate they have some 7s. However, I think I should make a higher bid rather than challenge. Since I have one 5 and one 8, I could reasonably bid \\'5 8s\\' (same quantity but higher digit) or increase the quantity to \\'6\\' with a lower digit that I have in my hand, like \\'6 0s\\', \\'6 1s\\', \\'6 3s\\', or \\'6 5s\\'. Given that I have two 3s in my hand, bidding \\'6 3s\\' seems most reasonable.\", \"action\": \"BID: 6 3s\"}', type='text')"
