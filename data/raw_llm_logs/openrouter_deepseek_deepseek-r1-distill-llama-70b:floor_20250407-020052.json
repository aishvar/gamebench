You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and I need to figure out my next move. Let me start by understanding the game state and the rules.\n\nFirst, my hand is 78064533. That means I have the digits 7, 8, 0, 6, 4, 5, 3, 3. So, in my hand, I have two 3s, and one each of 0,4,5,6,7,8. No 9s at all. \n\nThe current bid is 3 9s, made by Player 1. The bid history shows that I started with 2 3s, then Player 1 bid 2 4s, I went up to 3 3s, and then Player 1 jumped to 3 9s. So, the bidding has been increasing in terms of quantity and digit value.\n\nNow, I need to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid. Let's think about the possible options.\n\nIf I challenge, the total number of 9s in both our hands will be revealed. Since I have zero 9s, Player 1 must have all the 9s. The maximum number of 9s they can have is 8, since each player has 8 digits. But the bid is 3 9s, which is lower than 8, so it's possible. However, considering that the previous bids were about lower digits, maybe Player 1 is trying to shift the focus to a higher digit where they might have more.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to make a higher bid. To do that, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since the current bid is 3 9s, the next possible bid could be 4 of any digit, but the digit has to be higher than 9, which isn't possible. Alternatively, I could bid 4 of a lower digit, but that wouldn't be a valid higher bid because the digit is lower. Wait, no, higher bid means either higher quantity or same quantity but higher digit. Since 9 is the highest digit, I can't go higher in digit. So, the only way is to increase the quantity. So, the next possible bid would have to be 4 of a digit that's lower than 9, but that's not a higher bid because the digit is lower. Hmm, wait, no. The rules say that a higher bid is either a higher quantity or the same quantity but a higher digit. So, if I bid 4 of any digit, it's a higher quantity than 3, so that's acceptable regardless of the digit. But I need to choose a digit where I think there are at least 4 in total.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 3s. So, if I bid 4 3s, I'm hoping that Player 1 has at least two 3s. But I don't know their hand. Alternatively, I could bid on another digit that I have multiple of. Wait, I only have two 3s, and one each of the others. So, maybe 4 3s is a possibility, but it's risky because I don't know if Player 1 has any 3s.\n\nAlternatively, I could look for digits that are common. Let's see, in my hand, I have 0,3,3,4,5,6,7,8. No 1s or 2s. So, maybe digits like 3,4,5,6,7,8 are present, but I don't know about the opponent's.\n\nIf I bid 4 3s, and if the total is less than 4, I lose. But I have two, so the opponent would need at least two. If they have none, then total is two, which is less than four, so I lose. If they have one, total is three, still less than four. If they have two, total is four, which meets the bid. So, it's a bit risky.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a digit that I have only one of, but that's even riskier because I don't know the opponent's.\n\nAnother approach is to think about what Player 1 might have. They bid 3 9s, so maybe they have three 9s. But since I have none, they could have three. Alternatively, they might be bluffing.\n\nIf I challenge, and the total 9s are less than 3, I win. If it's 3 or more, they win. Since I have zero, they need at least three. But since each player has eight digits, the maximum they can have is eight, but the bid is three, so it's possible. But is it likely? Maybe they have three 9s, but maybe not. It's a bit uncertain.\n\nAlternatively, if I make a bid, I have to choose a digit and quantity that I think is safe. Let's see, I have two 3s. If I bid 4 3s, I need the opponent to have at least two. But I don't know. Alternatively, I could bid 4 5s, but I have only one 5. That's risky.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the bid history. The previous bids were 2 3s, 2 4s, 3 3s, and then 3 9s. So, Player 1 jumped from 2 4s to 3 9s, which is a big jump. Maybe they are trying to represent that they have a lot of 9s. But since I have none, it's possible they have three, but not more. Or maybe they're bluffing.\n\nIf I challenge, and the total is less than 3, I win. If it's 3 or more, I lose. So, the risk is that if they have exactly three, I lose. But if they have two or less, I win. Since I have zero, they could have three, but it's possible they have less.\n\nAlternatively, if I make a bid, I have to choose a digit and quantity that I think is achievable. Let's see, I have two 3s. So, maybe I can bid 4 3s, hoping that the opponent has at least two. But that's a 50-50 chance, which is risky.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a digit I have only one of, but that's even riskier. For example, 4 8s. I have one 8, so opponent would need three. But I don't know if they have that.\n\nAnother thought: the maximum number of any digit is 16 (8 each). So, for 9s, the maximum possible is 16, but the bid is 3. So, challenging might be safer if I think the opponent is bluffing.\n\nBut I don't have any 9s, so the opponent could have 3, but maybe they have less. If I challenge and they have 3, I lose. If they have less, I win. It's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, making a bid on a digit I have more of. I have two 3s. So, 4 3s. But as I thought earlier, it's risky.\n\nWait, maybe I can look at the bid history. The previous bids were about 3s and 4s, then jumped to 9s. Maybe the opponent is trying to shift focus. So, perhaps they don't have many 9s and are just trying to make me fold.\n\nIf I challenge, and they have less than 3, I win. If they have 3 or more, I lose. Since I have none, the opponent needs at least 3. But maybe they have exactly 3, or maybe they have more. But considering that they might be bluffing, perhaps challenging is the better option.\n\nAlternatively, if I make a bid, I have to choose a digit and quantity that I think is safe. Let me think about other digits. I have one 8, so maybe 4 8s. But I don't know if the opponent has three 8s. Unlikely, but possible.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 4 5s, but I have only one, so opponent needs three. Again, uncertain.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. I think challenging might be the safer option because the jump to 3 9s seems high, especially since I have none. Maybe the opponent is trying to bluff. So, I'll challenge.\n"
