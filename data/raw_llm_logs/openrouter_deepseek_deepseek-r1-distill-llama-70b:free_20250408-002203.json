You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let's see, it's my turn, and the current bid is None, which means I get to start the bidding. My hand is 52184338. Hmm, let me break that down. So, the digits I have are 5, 2, 1, 8, 4, 3, 3, and 8. \n\nWait, let me count how many of each digit I have. The digit 3 appears twice, and 8 appears twice as well. The rest of the digits\u20145, 2, 1, 4\u2014are each appearing once. So, in my hand alone, I have two 3s and two 8s. \n\nNow, since there are two players, each with 8 digits, the total number of digits in play is 16. So, the maximum possible for any digit is 16, but that's only if both players have all their digits as that number, which is impossible because each player has 8 unique digits or some duplicates. \n\nSince I have two 3s, maybe I can bid on 3s. But I don't know what the other player has. If I bid 2 3s, that's a safe bet because I have two, but the other player could have more, but maybe they don't. Alternatively, I could bid higher, but I don't want to overbid. \n\nWait, the current bid is None, so I can start with any bid. Maybe I should start low to test the waters. If I bid 2 3s, it's a safe bet because I have two, and the other player might not have any, making the total exactly two. But if the other player has more, then the bid would be higher. Alternatively, I could bid 3 3s, but I only have two, so that might be risky unless the other player has at least one more 3. \n\nAlternatively, looking at my 8s, I have two of them. So maybe I could bid 2 8s as well. But again, the same logic applies. I could go for 2 8s or maybe even 3 8s if I think the other player has one. \n\nWait, but since I'm the first to bid, maybe I should pick a digit that I have multiple of and a lower value to make it harder for the opponent to challenge. Let me think about the digits I have. I have 3s and 8s as duplicates. 3 is a lower digit than 8, so maybe starting with 3s is better because it's a lower digit, making it easier to potentially increase later. \n\nSo, if I bid 2 3s, that's a safe start. Alternatively, I could bid 3 3s, but that's a bit riskier. Or maybe I could bid 2 8s, but 8 is a higher digit, so if I start with that, the opponent might find it harder to challenge because higher digits are less likely to have more counts. \n\nWait, but higher digits are less likely to have higher counts because they are less common. So maybe starting with a lower digit is better because it's more likely to have more in total. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the distribution. Since I have two 3s, and if the other player has none, the total is two. If they have one, it's three, and if they have two, it's four. So, if I bid 2 3s, it's safe, but if I bid 3 3s, it's possible if the opponent has at least one. \n\nBut since I'm starting, maybe I should bid something that I can back up. So, 2 3s is a safe bid because I have two, and the opponent can't have more than six 3s (since they have 8 digits), but that's unlikely. So, 2 3s is a good starting point. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 8s. Since 8 is a higher digit, maybe the opponent is less likely to have many, but I have two. So, 2 8s might be a good bid as well. \n\nI think I'll go with 2 3s because 3 is a lower digit, and it's easier to build upon. If the opponent challenges, I know I have two, so if the total is at least two, I win. If they don't challenge, I can maybe increase the bid later. \n\nWait, but maybe I should consider the maximum possible. If I bid 2 3s, the opponent could have up to 6 more, making the total 8, but that's a lot. But I don't know. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should bid 3 3s. If I have two and the opponent has one, that's three. So, it's possible. But if the opponent has none, I lose. So, it's a bit risky. \n\nI think 2 3s is safer. So, I'll go with that.\n"
