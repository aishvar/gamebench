        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn. The current bid is None, which means I get to make the first bid. My hand is 34120691. Hmm, what digits do I have here? Let me break it down.\n\nSo, looking at each digit: 3, 4, 1, 2, 0, 6, 9, 1. Wait, I have two 1s. That's interesting. Also, the other digits are single. So, I have two 1s, and the rest are unique.\n\nSince the current bid is None, I can start by bidding on any digit. I want to choose a digit that I have at least one of, to have some confidence. The 1s seem like a good choice because I have two of them. If I bid on 1s, I can say at least two 1s exist in total.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider higher digits to have a stronger position. But since it's the first bid, starting with a lower quantity might be safer. If I bid 2 1s, it's a safe bet because I have two, and the opponent might have more. Plus, it's a low quantity, so it's harder to challenge.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a higher digit like 3 or 4, but I only have one of each. That might be riskier because if the opponent doesn't have any, the total could be just one, which is below my bid. So, 2 1s seems like a solid starting point.\n\nI should also think about the possible maximum. The total number of digits is 16 (8 each), so the maximum any digit can have is 16. But that's rare. For 1s, having two in my hand is a good indicator that there might be more, but it's not certain. Still, starting with 2 1s is reasonable.\n\nAnother thought: if I bid higher, like 3 1s, that might be too much. The opponent might have only one or none, making the total 2 or 3. But if I bid 2, I'm sure I have at least that. So, better to start low and see how the opponent reacts.\n\nAlright, I think I'll go with bidding 2 1s. It's a safe move, and I have the cards to back it up. Plus, it's the first bid, so it's a good way to set the tone without overcommitting.\n"
