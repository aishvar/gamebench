You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and I need to figure out my next move. Let's see, the current bid is 2 1s from Player 0. My hand is 80835926. Hmm, I should analyze this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to look at my own digits. Let me count them: 8, 0, 8, 3, 5, 9, 2, 6. So I have two 8s, one 0, one 3, one 5, one 9, one 2, and one 6. That means I don't have any 1s in my hand. So the total number of 1s in the game can only come from Player 0's hand, since I have none.\n\nPlayer 0 bid 2 1s. Since I have zero 1s, Player 0 must have at least two 1s for the bid to be valid. But wait, maybe they're bluffing. I need to think about the possible maximums. There are 8 digits each, so 16 in total. The maximum any digit can have is 16, but that's extremely rare.\n\nGiven that my hand has no 1s, if Player 0 has two 1s, that would make the total exactly two. If they have more, the total would be higher. But if they have less, the bid would be invalid. So, is it likely that Player 0 has two or more 1s?\n\nI also need to consider the bidding strategy. Since the current bid is low (2 1s), I have the option to either challenge or make a higher bid. If I challenge, and the total is less than 2, I win. If it's 2 or more, Player 0 wins.\n\nAlternatively, I could make a higher bid. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I don't have any 1s, bidding on 1s isn't helpful. Maybe I can bid on another digit where I have more.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 8s. So I could potentially bid on 8s. The current bid is 2 1s. So I could bid 2 8s, which is a higher digit, or even 3 8s if I think there are enough in total.\n\nBut wait, I only have two 8s, so the maximum possible 8s in the game is my two plus whatever Player 0 has. If I bid 3 8s, and Player 0 has at least one 8, then the total would be three. But if Player 0 has none, then the total is two, which is less than my bid, making me lose if challenged.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 8s. Since 8 is higher than 1, this would be a valid higher bid. But is that the best move? If I bid 2 8s, Player 0 might challenge if they don't have any 8s, but if they do, they might let it pass.\n\nHmm, but I don't know Player 0's hand. They might have 8s or not. If I bid 2 8s, and they have one, the total is three, which is higher than my bid. If they have none, the total is two, which matches my bid. So in either case, my bid would be valid if challenged.\n\nBut wait, the bid has to be strictly higher. So if I bid 2 8s, and the total is exactly two, that's equal to my bid. So if someone challenges, I would win because the count is equal to the bid. So that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid a higher quantity on 8s, like 3 8s, but that's riskier because I only have two. If Player 0 has one, it's three, which is good. If they have none, it's two, which is less than my bid, so I'd lose.\n\nSo maybe bidding 2 8s is safer. Alternatively, I could challenge the current bid of 2 1s. Since I have zero 1s, I think it's possible that Player 0 has two, but maybe they have more. If I challenge, and the total is two or more, I lose. If it's less, I win.\n\nBut considering that the maximum possible 1s is 8 (if Player 0 has all 1s), but that's unlikely. More realistically, they might have two or three. So challenging might be risky because there's a good chance the bid is valid.\n\nAlternatively, making a bid on 8s seems safer because I know I have two, and if Player 0 has at least one, it's a good bid. If not, it's still exactly two, which is valid.\n\nSo I think the best move is to bid 2 8s. It's a higher digit than 1s, and I have enough in my hand to make it potentially valid, depending on Player 0's hand.\n"
