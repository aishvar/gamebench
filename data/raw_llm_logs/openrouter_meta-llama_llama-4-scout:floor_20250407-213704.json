To make a valid higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one '7', bidding higher on '7' is risky without knowing Player 0's full hand. However, I can try to bid on a higher digit. I notice I have two '8's and one '9', but no higher quantity of any single digit than 2. A safe bet would be to bid on a higher digit that I have multiple instances of or a digit that could reasonably be high across both players' hands. Given I have two '8's, bidding '3 8s' seems reasonable as it increases both the quantity and the digit, making it a potentially strong bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 8s\"\n}\n```",
