In my hand (35916285), I have exactly one '3'. This means Player 0 would need at least three '3s' in their hand to make their bid valid. Statistically, it is possible for Player 0 to have three or more '3s', but it is not guaranteed. Since the bid is not overly high and there is room to increase the bid strategically, I will raise the bid to 5 3s. This puts pressure on Player 0 to either challenge or raise further, giving me more information about their confidence in their hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 5 3\"\n}\n```",
