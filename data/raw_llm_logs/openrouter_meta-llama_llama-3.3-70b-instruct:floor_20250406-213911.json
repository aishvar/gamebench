        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

My hand contains two 5s, two 8s, one 3, one 6, one 0, and one 2. Since I have two of the digit 5 and considering the diversity of my hand, bidding on a digit I have the most of seems strategic. However, to ensure a higher chance of winning, I'll choose a digit that is less likely to be abundant in the other player's hand due to the nature of the game. Given my hand and the aim to start with a bid that is reasonable yet cautious, I will bid on the digit that seems moderately represented in my hand but not overly abundant, keeping in mind the total possible count across both hands could be up to 16 for any digit. Since I have two 5s and two 8s, and considering the need to start with a bid that allows for future strategic maneuvering, I'll choose a bid that reflects my hand's composition while being mindful of the potential distribution in the other player's hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 5s\"\n}",
