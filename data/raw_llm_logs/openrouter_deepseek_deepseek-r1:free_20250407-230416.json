You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to make the first bid in this game of Liar's Poker. My hand is 92690683. Let me count how many of each digit I have.\n\nLooking at my digits: 9, 2, 6, 9, 0, 6, 8, 3. So breaking it down:\n\n- 0: 1\n- 2: 1\n- 3: 1\n- 6: 2\n- 8: 1\n- 9: 2\n\nSo the digits I have the most of are 6 and 9, each with two. Since the current bid is None, I can start with any valid bid. The first bid has to be at least 1 of any digit. But I want to make a bid that's a good starting point, considering my own hand and the likelihood that the opponent has some of the same digits.\n\nIf I bid on 2 6s or 2 9s, that's based on my own hand. But since there are two players, each with 8 digits, the total possible for any digit is 16. But starting with a low bid might be safer. However, since I have two 6s and two 9s, maybe I can start with a bid that's higher than the minimum but still plausible.\n\nWait, the first bid can be any quantity as long as it's at least 1. But since there's no previous bid, I can choose any. However, the next player has to either bid higher or challenge. So maybe starting with a bid that's a bit higher than the minimum could set the tone. For example, if I bid 3 of a digit, that's possible. Let's think: if I have two 6s, the opponent could have one or two more. So total could be up to 4. But if I bid 3 6s, that's possible. Alternatively, since 0s and 1s might be less common, but I have one 0. Maybe 2 0s? But I only have one, so that's risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher digit. For example, 2 9s. Since I have two, the opponent might have one or two, making the total 3 or 4. But the bid is 2, which is safe. But since the first bid can be anything, maybe starting with a lower quantity but higher digit. Wait, the rules say the first bid must be strictly higher than the current bid, which is None. But how does that work? Wait, the initial bid can be any valid bid because there's no previous bid. So the first player can bid any quantity from 1 to 16, any digit. So the first bid is just the starting point.\n\nIn that case, I should choose a bid that's based on my hand but also gives me some flexibility. Since I have two 6s and two 9s, maybe bid 3 6s. That way, even if the opponent has one or two, the total could be 3 or 4, which would make my bid valid. Alternatively, bid 2 9s, which is exactly what I have, but the opponent might have more. But since I have two, the total is at least two. But if I bid 2 9s, the next player can bid higher by increasing the quantity or the digit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher digit. For example, 2 9s. If I bid 2 9s, the next player can either bid 3 of any digit or 2 of a higher digit. But 9 is the highest digit, so they can't go higher in digit. So they'd have to increase the quantity. That might force them to bid 3 of something, which could be risky. But if I have two 9s, the total could be up to 4 (if opponent has two). So 2 is safe, but maybe I can go higher. Wait, but if I bid 3 9s, that's a higher quantity. But if the opponent has none, then the total is 2, which would make my bid invalid. So that's risky. So maybe better to start with a lower quantity but a digit I have a couple of. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a lower digit but higher quantity. For example, 3 0s. I have one 0, so the opponent could have two, making the total 3. But that's a gamble. Alternatively, 2 6s. I have two, so the total is at least two. If I bid 2 6s, the next player can bid 3 of any digit or 2 of a higher digit. Since 6 is not the highest, they could bid 2 7s, 8s, or 9s. But if they have some of those, they might challenge. \n\nWait, but since I have two 6s and two 9s, maybe starting with 2 9s is better because 9 is a higher digit, making it harder for the opponent to bid higher without increasing the quantity. Since 9 is the highest digit, the next player can't bid a higher digit, so they have to increase the quantity. So if I bid 2 9s, the next player has to bid at least 3 of any digit. That might force them into a position where they have to make a higher bid that's riskier. \n\nAlternatively, if I start with 2 6s, the opponent can bid 2 7s, 8s, or 9s, which might be easier if they have those digits. So maybe starting with a higher digit is better. \n\nBut considering that I have two 9s, bidding 2 9s is safe because the total is at least two. If the opponent has none, then the total is two, which meets the bid. If they have one, it's three. So my bid is valid. Then the opponent has to bid higher. If they bid 3 of any digit, say 3 0s, then I can challenge if I think that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, if I start with 2 9s, and the opponent has to bid higher, they might have to go to 3 of something. But if they have a lot of a lower digit, they could bid 3 of that. But since I have two 9s, maybe that's a solid opening. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher quantity. For example, 4 0s. But I only have one 0. The opponent could have up to 7, but that's unlikely. So that's risky. \n\nAlternatively, 3 6s. I have two, so the opponent needs at least one more. If they have one, total is three. If they have none, then it's two, which is less than three, so my bid would be invalid. So that's a risk. \n\nSo perhaps the safest opening is to bid 2 9s, since I have two, ensuring that the total is at least two. That way, even if the opponent has none, the bid is still valid. Then the opponent has to either bid higher quantity or a higher digit, but since 9 is the highest, they have to bid 3 of something. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 1 9. But that's the minimum, and the opponent can easily bid higher. So starting with 2 9s seems better. \n\nSo the action would be to bid 2 9s. That's my initial thought.\n"
