You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. So, I'm Player 0 in this game of Liar's Poker. My hand is 4, 9, 1, 6, 5, 0, 0, 1. That's eight digits. The current bid is None, so I need to make the first bid. \n\nFirst, I should count how many of each digit I have. Let's go through my hand:\n\n- 0: I have two 0s (the digits are 0 and 0).\n- 1: I have two 1s (the 1 and 1).\n- 4: One 4.\n- 5: One 5.\n- 6: One 6.\n- 9: One 9.\n\nSo in my hand, the most frequent digits are 0 and 1, each appearing twice. The other digits are single occurrences. Since the total number of digits across both players is 16 (each has 8), the opponent has 8 digits. \n\nSince it's the first bid, I need to start with a bid that's not too high but also gives me some flexibility. The bid has to be strictly higher than None, so any valid bid is acceptable. But I should aim for a bid that's likely to be true based on my hand, but also not easy for the opponent to challenge immediately.\n\nLet's consider possible bids. The lowest possible bid is 1 of any digit. But since I have two 0s and two 1s, maybe I can start with a bid that reflects that. For example, if I bid 2 0s, that's based on my own hand. But since there are 8 more digits in the opponent's hand, there could be more 0s. But maybe starting with a lower bid gives me more room to escalate later.\n\nAlternatively, starting with a higher digit might be better. For example, if I bid 2 5s, but I only have one 5. That's risky because the opponent might not have any 5s. But if I bid 2 1s, I have two 1s, so even if the opponent has none, the total is 2. Wait, but the bid requires the total count to be at least the quantity. So if I bid 2 1s, and I have two, even if the opponent has none, the total is exactly 2, which meets the bid. So that's safe. But maybe the opponent has more 1s, so the total could be higher. \n\nAlternatively, starting with 2 0s. Same logic. Since I have two 0s, the opponent could have more, but even if they have none, it's exactly 2. So bidding 2 0s or 2 1s is safe. But maybe starting with a higher digit would be better. For example, 2 9s. But I only have one 9. So the opponent would need at least one 9 for the total to reach 2. That's riskier. \n\nWait, but the opponent has 8 digits. The chance that they have at least one 0 or 1 is higher than them having a 9. So maybe starting with the digits that I have more of is better. Let's think about the probability. \n\nThe opponent has 8 digits. The chance that they have at least one 0 is 1 minus the chance they have no 0s. There are 8 digits in their hand. The total number of digits in the deck is 10 digits (0-9), each with multiple copies. Wait, actually, in Liar's Poker, each player has a hand of 8 digits, which are drawn from a standard deck of 52 cards, but digits are 0-9. However, the exact distribution might vary based on the rules, but in this case, the problem states that each player has 8 secret digits. It's unclear if digits are drawn with replacement or not, but perhaps it's assumed that all 16 digits (8 each) are randomly selected from 0-9, allowing duplicates. So the opponent's digits are independent of mine. \n\nSo, considering that, the probability that the opponent has at least one 0 is higher than, say, a 9. But maybe I should base my bid on what I have. Since I have two 0s, even if the opponent has none, the total is two. So if I bid 2 0s, that's a safe bid. Similarly for 2 1s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a lower quantity but a higher digit. For example, 1 9s. But that's a lower bid than 2 of a lower digit. Wait, the rules say that a bid is higher if the quantity is higher, or same quantity but higher digit. So, for example, 2 0s is higher than 1 9s because the quantity is higher. So starting with 2 0s would be a stronger bid. \n\nSince I have two 0s, and the opponent could have more, but even if they have none, the bid is still valid. So that's a safe opening. Alternatively, I could start with a higher digit. For example, 2 9s would be a higher bid than 2 0s because the digit is higher. Wait, no. The rules state that a higher bid is either higher quantity or same quantity but higher digit. So 2 9s is a higher bid than 2 0s because 9 is higher than 0. So if I bid 2 9s, that's a higher bid than 2 0s. \n\nBut I only have one 9. So the total would need to be at least 2. The opponent has 8 digits. The chance that they have at least one 9 is 1 - (9/10)^8 \u2248 1 - 0.4305 = 0.5695, so about 57% chance. That's a bit risky. Whereas if I bid 2 0s, I already have 2, so even if the opponent has none, the total is 2, which meets the bid. So that's 100% safe. \n\nSo between 2 0s and 2 9s, 2 0s is safer. But maybe I can start with a higher bid to put pressure on the opponent. But since it's the first move, maybe starting with a safe bid is better. \n\nAlternatively, considering that there are 16 digits in total, the maximum possible for any digit is 16. But that's if all 16 digits are the same, which is highly unlikely. \n\nWait, but the first bid has to be anything. So maybe starting with a low bid but safe. For example, 2 0s. Alternatively, 1 9s. But 2 0s is a higher bid than 1 9s because quantity is higher. So 2 0s is better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 3 0s. But I only have two. So the opponent would need to have at least one. The chance they have at least one 0 is about 1 - (9/10)^8 \u2248 57%, which is not bad. But if I bid 3 0s, and the opponent has none, then the total is 2, which is less than 3, so if they challenge, I lose. But since I'm the first bidder, maybe they won't challenge immediately unless they have a lot of confidence. \n\nBut perhaps starting with a safer bid is better. So 2 0s is safe. Let's see. If I bid 2 0s, and the opponent has, say, one 0, the total is 3, which is more than 2. So even if they have one, the bid is still valid. But wait, the bid is \"at least\" the quantity. So if I bid 2 0s, and the total is 3, that's still valid. The only way the bid is invalid is if the total is less than 2. Since I have two, the total is at least two, so the bid is always valid. Therefore, bidding 2 0s is 100% safe. That's a guaranteed valid bid. \n\nSimilarly, bidding 2 1s is also safe because I have two 1s. So either of those would be safe. But which is better? Since 0 is a lower digit, maybe starting with 2 0s allows the opponent to raise by either increasing the quantity (like 3 0s) or by keeping the quantity at 2 but raising the digit (like 2 1s). Alternatively, if I bid 2 1s, the opponent can go to 3 1s or 2 2s, etc. \n\nBut since 0 is the lowest digit, starting with 2 0s gives the opponent more flexibility to raise. Whereas starting with 2 1s might be slightly better because the digits are higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe starting with a higher digit to make it harder for the opponent to raise. For example, if I bid 2 9s, but that's risky because I only have one. But if I bid 2 0s, which is safe, but the opponent might challenge if they have none. Wait, but if I have two 0s, the total is at least two, so even if they have none, the total is two, so the bid is valid. Therefore, the opponent can't challenge successfully because the count is exactly two. So bidding 2 0s is safe. \n\nTherefore, the safest opening bid would be 2 0s or 2 1s. Since I have two of each, either is safe. But which is better? Maybe choosing the higher digit, so 2 1s. Because then the next player has to either bid higher quantity (like 3 of any digit) or same quantity but higher digit (like 2 2s or above). \n\nAlternatively, if I start with 2 0s, the opponent can bid 2 1s, which is higher. So maybe starting with the higher of the two digits I have. Since 1 is higher than 0, maybe bid 2 1s. That way, the opponent has to either go to 3 of any digit or 2 of a higher digit. That might be better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 2 5s. But I have one 5. So the opponent needs at least one 5. The chance they have at least one 5 is about 57% again. That's a bit risky. But if I bid 2 5s, and they have none, the total is 1, which is less than 2, so if they challenge, I lose. So that's risky. \n\nSo sticking with 2 0s or 2 1s is safer. Between them, perhaps 2 1s is better because it's a higher digit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe even higher. Let's see. If I bid 2 9s, but I have one. If the opponent has at least one 9, the total is two or more. But the probability is around 57%. So there's a 43% chance they have none. So that's a 43% chance of losing if they challenge. That's risky. \n\nSo the safest bets are 2 0s or 2 1s. Let's pick 2 1s. Because it's a higher digit than 0, making the next bid have to be higher. \n\nWait, but the rules say that a bid must be strictly higher. So if the current bid is 2 1s, the next bid can be 3 of any digit, or 2 of a digit higher than 1. So 2 2s, 2 3s, etc. \n\nBut maybe starting with 2 1s is better because it's higher, but still safe. \n\nAlternatively, if I start with 2 0s, the next player can bid 2 1s, which is higher. So perhaps starting with 2 1s prevents that. \n\nWait, no. If I bid 2 0s, the next player can bid 2 1s, which is allowed because the quantity is the same but the digit is higher. If I bid 2 1s, they can bid 2 2s, etc. \n\nSo maybe it's better to start with the highest possible digit that I can safely bid. In my hand, the highest digits are 9, but I only have one. So that's risky. The next highest is 6, which I have one. So if I bid 2 6s, but I have one, the opponent needs at least one. Again, risky. \n\nSo sticking with 2 1s is safe. Because I have two, so even if the opponent has none, total is two. Therefore, the bid is valid. \n\nTherefore, the action should be BID: 2 1s. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. My hand has 49165001. Let me count again. \n\nDigits in my hand: 4,9,1,6,5,0,0,1. So 0 appears twice, 1 appears twice, and the rest once each. So yes, two 1s. \n\nSo bidding 2 1s is safe. Therefore, the action is BID: 2 1s.\n"
