        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 7s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s.

Since the bid is about the total count across both players' hands, and without knowing Player 1's hand, it's difficult to assess the likelihood of there being at least two 7s. However, considering the nature of Liar's Poker, which involves bluffing and strategic guessing, and the fact that the current bid is relatively low, I should consider making a higher bid based on a digit I have a good count of in my hand or challenging if I believe the current bid is unlikely. Given my hand has no digits with a higher count than 2 (except for 1s and possibly other digits not visible), and the current bid is on 7s, a safe strategy would be to increase the quantity or the digit. Since I only have one 7, increasing the quantity of 7s might not be the best strategy without more information. However, I can consider bidding on a different digit where I have a higher or equal count, or challenge the current bid if it seems improbable. Looking at my hand again, I see I have two 1s, two 3s, and two 6s. The highest digit I can bid on with confidence, considering the current bid, would be to match the quantity but increase the digit, which is not feasible since 7 is already bid, or increase the quantity of a digit I have. Since challenging seems risky without a clear indication that the bid is false, and given that I have a couple of digits with a count of 2, I could consider bidding on one of those digits if I were to increase the quantity. But given the current bid is on 7s and I only have one 7, my best move, considering strategic play and the information I have, would be to challenge the bid if I think it's unlikely there are at least two 7s in both hands combined, or find a suitable digit to bid on. Given these considerations and looking to make a move that is strategically sound, I decide to focus on the challenge aspect due to the uncertainty and the relatively low bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
