The opponent claims there are at least 3 sixes total, which means they must have at least 3 sixes in their hand (since I have none). While this is possible, it\\'s not extremely likely. The probability of having exactly 3 sixes in 8 random digits is about 21.5%. However, I need to either challenge or make a higher bid. If I bid, I could go to \\'3 7s\\', \\'3 8s\\', \\'3 9s\\', \\'4 0s\\', \\'4 1s\\', etc. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s, two 1s, and one each of 9, 4, and 0. The most common digit in my hand is 3 or 1 (2 each). Since I have 2 threes, the opponent would need only 1 more three to make \\'3 3s\\' valid, which seems reasonably likely.
