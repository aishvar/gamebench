For the bid to be valid, there must be at least two 4s total across both hands. Since I only have one, the opponent must have at least one 4 for the bid to be true. This is plausible. To increase pressure strategically, I can make a safe incremental bid. I have two '3's, so a bid of 3 3s would be reasonable, but it must be higher in quantity or digit. Bidding 3 3s overtakes 2 4s by quantity, which is valid and conservative. Alternatively, I could bid 3 4s, but since I only have one 4, it would require the opponent to have at least two, which is riskier. Therefore, the best move is to bid 3 3s.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 3\"\n}",
