Since each player has 8 digits, a total of 16 digits, 2 fives is plausible but not guaranteed. However, since I have zero fives, the probability that the opponent holds exactly two or more fives is relatively low (roughly 15% chance). Given this low likelihood and the fact that the opponent started with this bid (often a bluff or a probing bid), challenging is a reasonable strategy here.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
