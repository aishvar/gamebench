Since there are 8 digits in my opponent's hand, the total number of sixes across both hands can be anywhere from 0 to 8. The bid of 1 six is quite conservative and very likely to be true, as it only requires there to be a single six in the opponent's hand. Therefore, challenging now would be premature. The best move is to increase the bid to maintain pressure and gather more information. A straightforward higher bid would be 1 seven, since it increases the digit without increasing the count, which is the minimal increment.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 1 7s\"\n}",
