        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '4 0s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Since the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16 and we are already at a bid of 4, increasing the quantity further might be risky without more information. However, considering the bidding history and the fact that '0' is not a commonly high-bid digit, I could consider challenging this bid or making a strategic bid. Given that my hand does not offer a clear advantage for bidding higher on '0s' and considering the risk of challenging, a safer approach might be to bid on a different digit that I have in abundance or seems plausible based on the history. Since I have two '1's and one '6' and '9', and given the history of bids, bidding on '1's could be a viable option as it's a new digit and doesn't directly compete with the current '0s' bid. Bidding '5 1s' seems like a reasonable move, considering I have two '1's and it's possible the other player might have a few '1's as well, given the distribution of digits.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 5 1s\"\n}",
