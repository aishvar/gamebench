        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 9s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the current situation. \n\nFirst, my hand is 45023973. Let me count the digits I have. Breaking it down: 4,5,0,2,3,9,7,3. So looking for 9s in my hand, I see only one 9. That's important because the current bid is 2 9s. \n\nHmm, so the current bid is 2 9s made by Player 0. My options are to either make a higher bid or challenge the current bid. \n\nIf I challenge, what happens? The total number of 9s across both hands will be counted. Since I have one 9, Player 0 must have at least one more 9 to make the total 2. But wait, I don't know what's in Player 0's hand. They could have one 9 or more. \n\nBut if I challenge and the total is less than 2, I win. If it's 2 or more, Player 0 wins. Considering that each player has 8 digits, the maximum number of 9s possible is 16, but that's extremely unlikely. \n\nI have one 9, so the minimum total is 1 (if Player 0 has none) and maximum is 9 (if Player 0 has all 8 digits as 9s, which is impossible because I have one). Wait, no, if I have one, then Player 0 can have up to 7 more, making the total 8. But 8 is possible only if Player 0 has seven 9s, which is very unlikely. \n\nSo the possible totals for 9s are between 1 and 8. The bid is 2 9s, so if the actual count is 1, challenging would make me win. But if it's 2 or more, Player 0 wins. \n\nGiven that, I have to assess the likelihood. Since I have one 9, it's possible that Player 0 has at least one more. But without more information, it's a gamble. \n\nAlternatively, I could make a higher bid. To do that, I need to bid a quantity higher than 2 or the same quantity but a higher digit. \n\nLooking at my hand, what digits do I have? 0,2,3,4,5,7,9. So I have two 3s. Maybe I can bid 3 3s. That would be higher than 2 9s because the quantity is higher. \n\nBut wait, the current bid is 2 9s. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or, if the quantity is the same, choose a higher digit. Since 3 3s has a higher quantity than 2 9s, that's a valid bid. \n\nBut is it a good move? I have two 3s, so the total number of 3s could be up to 10 (since both players have 8 digits each). If I bid 3 3s, I'm claiming there are at least three 3s in total. Considering I have two, Player 0 would need at least one more. \n\nIs that likely? I don't know. It depends on Player 0's hand. But without knowing, it's a risk. \n\nAlternatively, I could challenge the 2 9s. If I challenge and the total is less than 2, I win. But if it's 2 or more, I lose. \n\nGiven that I have one 9, the chance that Player 0 has at least one more is possible, but it's not guaranteed. So challenging might be a good move here because the bid is relatively high (2 9s), and with only one 9 in my hand, it's uncertain if Player 0 has another. \n\nWait, but the bid is 2 9s. If I challenge, and the total is 1, I win. If it's 2 or more, I lose. So it's a 50-50 chance, but considering that, maybe challenging is better than making a bid I'm not sure about. \n\nAlternatively, making a bid on a digit I have more of might be safer. For example, I have two 3s. Bidding 3 3s. But if Player 0 doesn't have any, the total is two, which is less than my bid, and I would lose. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. \n\nAnother angle: the current bid is 2 9s. If I challenge, and the total is 2, it means Player 0 has one 9, just like me. That would make the total 2, so the bid is valid, and Player 0 wins. \n\nBut if the total is 1, I win. So the question is, what's the likelihood that Player 0 has another 9. Without any info, it's hard to say. \n\nIn Liar's Poker, players often bluff, so a bid of 2 9s might be a bluff. Maybe Player 0 doesn't have any 9s and is trying to trick me. \n\nConsidering that, challenging might be a good move because if they're bluffing, I can win. \n\nSo, weighing the options, I think challenging the bid is the best move here. There's a chance that Player 0 doesn't have another 9, making the total 1, and I win. If they do, I lose, but given that 9s are high-value digits, it's possible they're bluffing. \n\nSo, I'll choose to challenge the current bid.\n"
