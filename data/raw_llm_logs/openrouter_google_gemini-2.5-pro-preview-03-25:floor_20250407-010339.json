        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '4 8s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

For the bid of 4 8s to be true, the other player (Player 1) must have at least four 8s in their 8-digit hand. While possible, requiring half of the opponent's hand to be a specific digit when I hold none of that digit makes the bid suspect. Player 1 has consistently bid on 8s (2 8s, 3 8s, 4 8s), which could indicate strength or a persistent bluff. Given I have no 8s to support the current bid, challenging seems statistically favorable compared to making a higher bid like 5 0s (requiring 3 from opponent) or 5 5s (requiring 3 from opponent), especially since Player 1's previous bid of 3 1s might suggest they don't hold many 0s or 5s either. The risk of Player 1 actually holding 4 or more 8s seems lower than the risk associated with escalating the bid further based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\n```",
