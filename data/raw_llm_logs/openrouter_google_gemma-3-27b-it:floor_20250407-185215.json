The opponent previously bid 4 0s after I bid 3 0s, indicating they likely have at least one 0. It's possible they have two or three 0s. Given the opponent's previous bid and my hand, it's plausible they have enough 1s to support the bid. However, bidding higher than 4 1s is risky. I will challenge the bid, as it seems unlikely that there are four 1s in total between both hands. If the opponent has more than one 1, they would have likely bid on 1s earlier. The opponent's earlier bid of 4 0s does not strongly suggest they have multiple 1s.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\n```",
