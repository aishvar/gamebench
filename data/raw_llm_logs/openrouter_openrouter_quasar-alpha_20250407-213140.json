Since I don't have any 8s, the only way Player 0's bid is valid is if they have at least one 8 in their hand. Given there are 16 digits total and only one 8 is claimed, this is plausible. It is risky to challenge such a low bid, as single occurrences are common. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to raise the bid slightly to maintain pressure and gather more information. I will increase the bid to 1 9s, which is a legal higher bid (since 9 > 8), and I have one 9 in my hand to support this bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 1 9s\"\n}",
