You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. My hand is 22483603. So I need to count how many of each digit I have. Let me list them out.\n\nDigits in my hand:\n2, 2, 4, 8, 3, 6, 0, 3.\n\nSo breaking it down:\n- 0: 1\n- 1: 0\n- 2: 2\n- 3: 2\n- 4: 1\n- 5: 0\n- 6: 1\n- 7: 0\n- 8: 1\n- 9: 0\n\nThe current bid is 2 1s by Player 0. Since I have 0 ones in my hand, the opponent (Player 0) would have to have at least 2 ones in their hand for their bid to be valid. But since each player has 8 digits, the total possible digits in the game are 16. So if the bid is 2 1s, the total number of 1s across both hands would need to be at least 2. Since I have none, they must have all 2. \n\nBut maybe I should consider what's the best move here. Since the current bid is low (2 1s), I can either bid higher or challenge. Let's think about possible bids. The next bid must be higher. To be higher than 2 1s, I can either increase the quantity (like 3 of any digit) or keep the quantity at 2 but choose a higher digit than 1. \n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 2s and two 3s. So if I bid on 2s, I already have 2 in my hand. The opponent could have more. If I bid 3 2s, that would be a higher quantity. Alternatively, I could bid 2 3s, which is same quantity but higher digit. Which is better?\n\nAlternatively, since the current bid is 2 1s, and I have zero, maybe the opponent is bluffing. They might not have two 1s. If I challenge now, the total 1s would be whatever they have. If they have two, they win. If they have less, I win. But since the bid is low, maybe they actually have it. If I challenge and they have two, I lose. But if they have one or none, I win.\n\nBut since the bid is 2 1s, and I have none, the total can't be more than 8 (since each player has 8 digits). Wait, no, the maximum possible 1s would be 8 in their hand plus 0 in mine, so 8 total. But the bid is only 2. So challenging a bid of 2 1s when I have zero... the total would be their count. If they have 2 or more, they're correct. If they have less than 2, I win.\n\nBut is it risky to challenge here? Maybe. Because they might have two 1s. But considering that there are 8 digits in their hand, the probability of them having at least two 1s... Well, if the digits are randomly distributed, but I don't know. Alternatively, maybe they have a reasonable number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a safer move is to bid higher. Let's see. If I bid 2 2s (same quantity, higher digit than 1s), that's a valid move. Since 2 is higher than 1. So 2 2s would be higher than 2 1s. But in my hand, I have two 2s. So the opponent could have more. So the total would be at least 2 (my two) plus whatever they have. If I bid 2 2s, then the next player could challenge. But if they have, say, zero 2s, the total is 2, which meets the bid. So that's safe. But if I bid 3 2s, that's a higher quantity. But I only have two, so opponent would need to have at least one. If they have one, total is 3. If they have none, total is 2, which is less than 3, so if they challenge, I lose. So maybe 2 2s is safer.\n\nAlternatively, bid 2 3s. I have two 3s. If I bid 2 3s, that's same quantity but higher digit. Then the opponent could challenge. If they have at least zero 3s, the total would be my two plus theirs. So if they have at least zero, total is at least two, which meets the bid. So that's safe. Because 2 3s would require total >=2. Since I have two, even if they have none, total is two. So that's a safe bid. Wait, that's a good point. If I bid 2 3s, since I already have two, the total can't be less than two. So even if the opponent has none, the total is two, which meets the bid. So that's a guaranteed safe bid. Because the bid is 2 3s, and the total is at least two (from my hand). Therefore, challenging that would make the challenger lose. So that's a safe move.\n\nSo bidding 2 3s would be a valid move, and it's higher than 2 1s. Because the digit 3 is higher than 1. So same quantity, higher digit. So the action would be BID: 2 3s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe even bid higher digits. Like 2 8s. But I only have one 8. So if I bid 2 8s, the opponent needs to have at least one. If they have none, total is 1, which is less than 2. So if they challenge, I lose. So that's risky. Whereas bidding 2 3s is safe because I have two.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to bid 2 3s. That's a safe bid, as it's guaranteed to be at least two in total (since I have two). So even if the opponent challenges, they'll lose.\n\nAlternatively, could I bid 3 of a digit? For example, 3 2s. I have two 2s. So opponent needs to have at least one. If they have one, total is three. If they have zero, total is two, which is less. So that's a risk. But if I think the opponent might have at least one 2, then it's okay. But since I have two, maybe they have one. But it's uncertain. So maybe 3 2s is a possible bid, but riskier than 2 3s.\n\nBut since 2 3s is a guaranteed safe bid (because total is at least two), that's better. So I should go with that.\n"
