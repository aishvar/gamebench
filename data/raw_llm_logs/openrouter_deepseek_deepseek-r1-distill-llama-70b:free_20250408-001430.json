        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, let's see. I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn to make a bid since there are no previous bids. My hand is 83435115, which I can analyze to figure out what digits I have. \n\nFirst, I'll list out my digits: 8, 3, 4, 3, 5, 1, 1, 5. So, I have two 1s, two 3s, two 5s, and one 4 and one 8. That gives me a good idea of what digits I can potentially bid on. \n\nSince the current bid is None, I can start the bidding. I need to make a bid that's as strong as possible but also believable. I don't want to overbid because that could backfire if someone challenges me. \n\nLooking at my hand, the digits that repeat are 1, 3, and 5. I have two of each. So, I can consider bidding on any of these. The digit 5 is higher than 3 and 1, so bidding on 5s might be better because higher digits are generally stronger bids. \n\nI have two 5s, so I can bid at least 2 5s. But maybe I can go higher. Since there are two players, each with 8 digits, the maximum possible for any digit is 16. However, that's very unlikely. So, I should aim for a reasonable number. \n\nIf I bid 3 5s, that means I'm claiming there are at least three 5s in total between both players. Since I have two, the opponent would need at least one 5 for this to be true. That's possible. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 5s, but that's a lower quantity. Bidding 3 5s is better because it's a higher bid, making it harder for the opponent to challenge without a good reason. \n\nI don't see any reason to challenge since there's no previous bid. So, the best move is to start with a bid of 3 5s. It's based on my hand, and it's a solid starting point without being too aggressive.\n"
