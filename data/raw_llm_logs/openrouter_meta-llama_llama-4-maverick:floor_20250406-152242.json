        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 2s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

The total count of 2s must be at least 3 (the bid quantity) or more for the bid to be valid. Since I have one 2, the other player must have at least 2 2s for the bid to be valid. It's possible but I need to consider the probability and the information from the bid history. The bid history shows a gradual increase in the digit, suggesting that the other player might be bidding based on some 2s. However, I also have other digits in my hand that could be used to make a higher bid. I can count my hand: 3 (0), 0 (1), 8 (2), 5 (3), 0 (4), 9 (5), 4 (6), 1 (7), 1 (8), 1 (9). I have a total of 1 '8' and 1 '9', and no other high digits in significant quantities. I can bid higher than 3 2s by bidding 3 3s or higher quantity with a lower or same digit. Since I have a '5', '8', and '9', I can consider bidding on a higher digit. Bidding 3 5s seems reasonable as it increases the digit and is based on my hand having a '5'.\", \"action\": \"BID: 3 5s\"}",
