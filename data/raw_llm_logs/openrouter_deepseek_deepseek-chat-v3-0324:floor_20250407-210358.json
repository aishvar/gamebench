The current bid is '1 2s', which means Player 0 is claiming there is at least one '2' between both our hands. Since I have no 2s, it's possible Player 0 has one 2, making the bid valid. However, since Player 0 is labeled 'Naive 50/50', they might be making random bids. Given that, there's a 50% chance the bid is invalid. Since the bid is low (only 1), it's safer to raise the bid to a digit I know exists in my hand rather than challenge. I have two 3s, so bidding '2 3s' would be a safe increase.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 3s\"\n}\n```",
