        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the situation. \n\nFirst, the game state shows that it's my turn, Player 0, and the current bid is None. That means I'm the first to make a bid. My hand is 80415872, which I should analyze to see what digits I have. Let me list them out: 8, 0, 4, 1, 5, 8, 7, 2. So, I have two 8s, and the rest are single digits. \n\nSince I'm the first to bid, I need to decide what to bid. I know that in Liar's Poker, the goal is to make a bid that's either higher in quantity or digit than the previous one, or challenge if you think it's a lie. But since there's no previous bid, I get to set the starting point.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 8s. That's a good starting point. I could bid 2 8s. But wait, maybe I can bid higher. Since the maximum quantity is 16, but that's probably too high. Maybe I can go for 3 of a digit I have multiple of. But I only have two 8s, so 3 might be risky unless the other player has at least one 8. \n\nAlternatively, I could choose a lower digit but higher quantity. For example, I have one 0, but that's not helpful. I have one 4, 1, 5, 7, and 2. Maybe I can go for a higher digit with a lower quantity. But since I have two 8s, which is a high digit, maybe I should start with that.\n\nIf I bid 2 8s, it's a safe bet because I have two, and the opponent might have none or one. If I challenge later, I can win if the total is less than 2. But since I'm starting, I should make a bid that's reasonable but not too high. \n\nAnother thought: maybe I can bid 1 of a higher digit, but since I have two 8s, starting with 2 8s seems better. It's a strong opening because 8 is a high digit, and having two of them gives me a solid foundation. \n\nI don't want to overbid because the opponent might challenge, and if the total is exactly 2, I win. But if I bid 3 8s and the opponent has none, I lose. So, 2 8s is safer. Plus, it's a straightforward bid that doesn't give away too much information about my hand.\n\nSo, I think the best move is to bid 2 8s. It's a confident start without being overly aggressive, and it gives me a good position to build on in the next turns.\n"
