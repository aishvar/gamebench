        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 5s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this game of Liar's Poker. Let me start by understanding the situation. \n\nFirst, the current bid is 3 5s, made by Player 0. My hand is 89301336. I need to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid. \n\nLooking at my hand, I have the digits: 8, 9, 3, 0, 1, 3, 3, 6. So, I have three 3s, one each of 8, 9, 0, 1, and 6. I don't have any 5s, which is important because the current bid is about 5s. \n\nSince I don't have any 5s, I can only rely on what I know about Player 0's possible digits and the overall probabilities. The total number of digits in play is 16 (8 each), so the maximum any digit can have is 16, but in reality, it's much lower.\n\nThe current bid is 3 5s. I need to assess whether there are at least 3 fives in both players' hands combined. Since I have none, Player 0 must have at least 3. But I don't know Player 0's hand, so I have to consider the likelihood.\n\nGiven that I have no 5s, Player 0 could have 3, but it's also possible they have more. However, 3 isn't a very high number, so maybe it's plausible. But I also have to think about the possible distribution of other digits. \n\nIf I challenge, and the total number of 5s is less than 3, I win. If it's 3 or more, Player 0 wins. Considering that 5s aren't that common, especially since I have none, it's possible that Player 0 is bluffing. But 3 isn't too high, so maybe they're telling the truth.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to make a higher bid. Since the current bid is 3 5s, I can either bid a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. But looking at my hand, I have three 3s. So I could bid 3 3s, but wait, 3 3s is lower than 3 5s because 3 is less than 5. So that wouldn't work. I need to bid either a higher quantity or a higher digit with the same quantity.\n\nSince I can't go higher in quantity without knowing, maybe I can't make a valid bid. So my options are limited. Therefore, challenging might be the safer option here because I don't have enough information to make a higher bid, and the current bid might be a bluff.\n\nWait, but I have three 3s. The current bid is 3 5s. If I bid 3 6s, that's higher because 6 is higher than 5. So I can make a bid of 3 6s because I have one 6, but I don't know how many 6s Player 0 has. But I can only bid based on what I have, but actually, in Liar's Poker, you can bid based on your hand, but you don't know the opponent's. So if I have at least one 6, I can bid 3 6s, hoping that the total is at least 3. But since I have one, Player 0 might have two or more. But it's risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to challenge because I don't have any 5s, and 3 might be a low number. But I'm not sure. I think challenging is safer because I don't have enough to make a higher bid confidently.\n"
