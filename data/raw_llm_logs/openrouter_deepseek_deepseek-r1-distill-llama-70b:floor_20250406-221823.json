You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and I need to figure out my first move. My hand is 68703257. Let me break this down. \n\nFirst, I should look at each digit in my hand. So, the digits I have are 6, 8, 7, 0, 3, 2, 5, and 7. Wait, that's two 7s. So, I have two of the digit 7. The other digits are all singletons. \n\nSince it's the first bid, the current bid is None, which means I can start with any bid I want. My goal is to make a bid that's likely to be true but also gives me an advantage. \n\nI know that in Liar's Poker, each player has 8 digits, so together there are 16 digits in total. The maximum possible for any digit is 16, but that's extremely rare. More realistically, the counts are much lower. \n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 7s. That's a good starting point. If I bid on 2 7s, that's a safe bet because I know I have two. But maybe I can go higher. Since I have two, the opponent could also have some 7s. The total could be 2, 3, or maybe even 4 if the opponent has two as well. \n\nHowever, I don't want to overbid. If I bid 3 7s and the opponent only has one, the total would be 3, which would make my bid valid. But if the opponent has none, the total would be 2, and I'd lose. So, is it safe to bid 3 7s? \n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 7s. That's definitely true, but it's a low bid, and the opponent might easily top it. But since it's the first move, I have the advantage of setting the tone. \n\nWait, another approach: I could look for the highest digit I have and see if I can make a bid on that. My highest digit is 8. I have one 8. So, if I bid 1 8s, that's true, but it's a very low bid. The opponent can easily bid higher. \n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a lower digit that I have multiple of. I have two 7s, which is more than any other digit. So, focusing on 7s seems better. \n\nIf I bid 2 7s, it's a solid start. The opponent might have 0, 1, or 2 7s. If they have 2, the total would be 4. If they have 1, it's 3. If they have none, it's 2. So, my bid of 2 7s is safe because the minimum total is 2. \n\nBut maybe I can push it a bit. If I bid 3 7s, the opponent would need at least one 7 for the total to be 3. If they have two, it's 4, which is still higher than my bid. So, 3 7s is also a possibility. \n\nHowever, if the opponent has zero 7s, then the total is 2, and my bid of 3 would be invalid. That's a risk. So, I need to decide whether to bid 2 or 3. \n\nSince I have two 7s, and the maximum the opponent can have is 8 digits, but they could have up to 8 of any digit, though that's unlikely. But for 7s, it's more probable they have 0-2. \n\nTo play it safe, I might stick with 2 7s. It's a sure thing, and the opponent can't challenge it because it's definitely true. Alternatively, bidding higher might give me an advantage if they don't challenge. \n\nBut since it's the first bid, setting a moderate bid might be better. If I bid too high, the opponent might challenge, and if I'm wrong, I lose. So, 2 7s seems like a good starting point. \n\nWait, another thought: the opponent might have more 7s than I think. But without any prior bids, I have to go with what I have. \n\nSo, I'll decide to bid 2 7s. It's a safe move that's definitely correct, and it doesn't risk me losing the challenge if the opponent calls me out. Plus, it's a low enough bid that the opponent might not want to challenge it right away, giving me an advantage in the next round.\n"
