Therefore, the bid '2 1s' is likely true, and challenging is risky. I should make a higher bid. I need to bid more than '2 1s' (either quantity > 2 or digit > 1). I have two '3's in my hand. Bidding '2 3s' is a safe bid, as I hold the required quantity myself, making the bid guaranteed to be true regardless of the opponent's hand.
