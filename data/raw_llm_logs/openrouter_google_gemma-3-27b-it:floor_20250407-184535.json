A more conservative approach is to bid on a digit I have multiple of, or increase the quantity of a digit. I have one '1' and one '2'. Increasing the quantity of '0' to '3 0s' feels too aggressive. I have one '9', so bidding '1 9s' is a safe and reasonable increase. It's a valid bid and doesn't require my opponent to have a large number of '9's.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 1 9s\"\n}\n```",
