        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 6s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

Player 0 previously bid 2 6s, I bid 3 4s, and then Player 0 bid 3 6s. This sequence suggests Player 0 is confident about the number of 6s, likely having at least two 6s in their hand (making the total count 1 + 2 = 3). Challenging 3 6s seems risky as it's plausible Player 0 has the required two 6s. I need to make a higher bid. Possible bids are 3 7s, 3 8s, 3 9s, or 4 of any digit. I have two 4s, which is the digit I have the most of. Bidding 4 4s requires Player 0 to have at least two 4s among their 8 digits. While Player 0 didn't contest my previous 3 4s bid directly (they raised with 3 6s), bidding 4 4s is based on the strongest part of my hand and forces Player 0 to make a significantly higher bid or challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 4s\"\n}\n```",
