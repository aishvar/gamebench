This means Player 1 claims there are at least three 7s across both hands (16 digits total). Since I have two 7s, Player 1 only needs one 7 for their bid to be correct. The probability of Player 1 having at least one 7 in their 8 digits is reasonably high (1 - (9/10)^8 \u2248 57%). Therefore, challenging the bid seems risky, as it's slightly more likely to be true than false. I can make a higher bid. A bid of 3 8s is valid (same quantity, higher digit). This bid requires Player 1 to have at least one 8 for it to be true. Since I hold two 8s, this is also plausible (probability ~57%). Making this bid leverages my hand (two 8s), is a minimal increase, and puts the pressure back on Player 1. Bidding a quantity of 4 seems too aggressive at this early stage.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 8s\"\n}\n```",
