        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '8 9s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

Given that I have a 9 in my hand and the total count of 9s could potentially be high, I need to assess the likelihood of there being 8 or more 9s in total. Since there are 16 digits in total (8 from each player), and I have one 9, if the other player also has one 9, that would only account for 2 of the 9s. However, I do not have enough information to assume there are 8 or more 9s. My goal is to make a valid higher bid. I can see that bidding a higher quantity with a lower digit might be more feasible. I have a 9, and several other digits that could potentially be in the higher quantity range. A bid of 9 0s seems unlikely since there are only 16 digits total and 9 0s would be an extremely high count. I will increase the quantity and bid on a lower digit that I know exists in my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 9 0s\"\n}",
