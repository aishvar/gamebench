There are no 4s in my hand, so the total count of 4s is at most 8 (since the other player could have up to 8). However, the current bid is '2 4s', which is relatively low. Given that there are no 4s in my hand, it's possible that the other player has at least two 4s, making the bid plausible. Since the bid is low and plausible, it's better to make a higher bid rather than challenge. I can bid on a digit that I have in my hand to increase my chances. The digit '8' appears three times in my hand, so bidding '3 8s' is a safe and strategic move.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 8s\"\n}\n```",
