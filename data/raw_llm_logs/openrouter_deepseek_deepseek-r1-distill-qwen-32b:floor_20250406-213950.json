        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '4 2s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, I need to figure out the best move in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nFirst, my hand is 57422081. Let me count the digits I have:\n\n- 5: 1\n- 7: 1\n- 4: 1\n- 2: 2\n- 0: 1\n- 8: 1\n- 1: 1\n\nWait, that's 8 digits. So, I have two 2s and one each of 5,7,4,0,8,1.\n\nThe current bid is 4 2s made by Player 0. The bid history shows that Player 0 started with 2 3s, then Player 1 bid 3 2s, and Player 0 responded with 4 2s.\n\nSo, the last bid is 4 2s. My task is to either make a higher bid or challenge.\n\nTo make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or keep the same quantity but choose a higher digit. Since the current bid is 4 2s, the next bid could be 5 2s, or any digit higher than 2 with the same or higher quantity.\n\nBut I have two 2s in my hand. Player 0 has made two bids on 2s: first 3 2s, then 4 2s. That suggests they might have more 2s than me, but I'm not sure.\n\nIf I challenge, I have to consider the likelihood of the actual count being at least 4. The total digits are 16 (8 each). If Player 0's hand has, say, two 2s, and mine has two, that's four total. But if they have more, the count could be higher.\n\nWait, the current bid is 4 2s. If I challenge and the actual count is less than 4, I win. But if it's 4 or more, Player 0 wins. So, I need to assess the probability.\n\nPlayer 0 bid 4 2s after I bid 3 2s. That could mean they think there are at least 4, or they're bluffing. Since I have two 2s, there are potentially two more 2s in Player 0's hand.\n\nBut considering the previous bid was 3 2s from me, and they went to 4, they might have at least one 2. So, the total could be 3 or 4.\n\nIf I challenge, and the total is exactly 4, which is the bid, then Player 0 is correct. If it's less, I win.\n\nBut given that I have two 2s, and the opponent could have two, making it four, the challenge might be risky. Alternatively, if I bid higher, I could go to 5 2s, but I don't have enough info to support that.\n\nAlternatively, I could change the digit. For example, bid 4 3s. Since I don't have any 3s, but the previous bid was on 2s, maybe the opponent doesn't have many 3s.\n\nWait, in the initial bid, Player 0 started with 2 3s. So, they might have some 3s. If I bid 4 3s, I'm assuming there are at least four 3s in total, but I don't have any, so it's a bit risky.\n\nAnother option is to bid 4 4s. Since I have one 4, that's possible. But again, without knowing the opponent's hand, it's a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid a higher digit with the same quantity. For example, 4 5s. I have one 5, so maybe there's another 5 in the opponent's hand.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to be sure. Maybe challenging is safer here. The current bid is 4 2s, and considering I have two, the opponent might have two, making it four. If they have only one, then it's three, which would make the bid invalid.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe challenging is the better move here, as the bid seems a bit high if both players only have two each.\n\nSo, I think I'll choose to challenge the bid.\n"
