        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 9s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

I count two 9s, but since I don't have any 9s, it's likely that the other player has at least three 9s or is bluffing. However, given that I have 8 digits and none of them are 9s, it's possible the other player has more than three 9s. The bid history started with 2 6s, then 2 9s, then 3 0s, and now 3 9s. The jump from 2 9s to 3 0s and then to 3 9s indicates a possible bluff or a strong hand. Since my hand doesn't contain any 9s, and the quantity is already 3, I should either challenge or make a higher bid. I can bid higher by either increasing the quantity or bidding the same quantity with a higher digit. I can see that I have a total of 2 6s and 2 5s. A reasonable next step is to increase the quantity or bid a higher digit. Bidding 4 0s seems plausible as it increases the quantity.\", \"action\": \"BID: 4 0s\"}",
