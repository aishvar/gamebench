You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s.

                    "reasoning": "\nOkay, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn. Let me see what I have here. My hand is 67214705. That's eight digits: 6,7,2,1,4,7,0,5. I need to make a bid or challenge, but since the current bid is None, I have to make the first bid.\n\nHmm, the rules say each player has 8 digits, so the total across both players is 16. My hand has some digits, but I don't know what the other player has. So I need to make an educated guess about the total count of a specific digit.\n\nLooking at my hand, let's count the digits I have:\n\n- 0: 1\n- 1: 1\n- 2: 1\n- 4: 1\n- 5: 1\n- 6: 1\n- 7: 2\n\nSo I have two 7s. That's the highest count in my hand. Maybe I can bid on 7s. But I also have some other digits, but their counts are lower.\n\nIf I bid on 7s, I have two of them. The other player could have some 7s as well. The maximum possible is 16, but realistically, it's much lower. Since I have two, maybe I can bid 3 7s. That way, I'm assuming the other player has at least one more 7.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a higher digit with a lower count. For example, I have one 6. If I bid 2 6s, that might be risky because the other player might not have any. But if I bid 3 6s, that's even riskier. Maybe 7s are safer since I have two.\n\nWait, what's the strategic move here? I want to make a bid that's likely to be true but also forces the opponent into a tough spot. Bidding 3 7s seems reasonable because I have two, and the other player might have one or two. It's a medium bid, not too high, but enough to potentially make the opponent think twice.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on a lower digit with a higher quantity. For example, 4 0s. I have one 0, so if I bid 4 0s, I'm assuming the other player has three. That might be a stretch because 0s are less likely to be held in high quantities, but it's possible.\n\nBut considering I have two 7s, it's safer to base my bid on that. So I'll go with 3 7s. That's a reasonable increase from zero, and it's based on my hand's strength.\n\nWait, the current bid is None, so I can start with any bid. I just need to make sure it's a valid bid. So 3 7s is a good starting point. It's not too high, but it's higher than zero, and it's based on my actual hand.\n\nI think that's the best move. I'll bid 3 7s.\n"
