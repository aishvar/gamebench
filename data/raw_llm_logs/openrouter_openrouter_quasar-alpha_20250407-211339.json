My hand is 08749263, which contains the digits: 0, 8, 7, 4, 9, 2, 6, 3 \u2014 all unique, each appearing once. Since no digit repeats, I have exactly one of each. Statistically, the digit '0' or '1' tend to be safer opening bids, but given my hand, any digit is equally viable. I will start conservatively with a bid of 2 for the digit '1', since it's common overall and likely to be in the opponent's hand, even though I have zero '1's myself. However, since I have no '1's, it might be better to bid on a digit I do hold. I'll choose '8', which I have one of, expecting there might be at least one more in the opponent's hand, making a bid of 2 '8's a reasonable starting point.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 8\"\n}",
