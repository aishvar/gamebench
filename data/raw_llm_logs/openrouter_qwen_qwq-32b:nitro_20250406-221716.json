You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to decide whether to challenge the current bid of 5 6s or make a higher bid. My hand is 05123937. Let me check how many 6s I have here. Looking at each digit: 0, 5, 1, 2, 3, 9, 3, 7. Hmm, I don't see any 6s in my hand. That means the total number of 6s in both hands can't exceed whatever the opponent has. Since the current bid is 5 6s, and I have zero, the opponent must have at least 5? But that's impossible because they only have 8 digits. Wait, the maximum they could have is 8 of the same digit, but even then, adding my 0, the total would be 8. So 5 is possible if they have 5 or more. But maybe they're bluffing. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid higher, I need to go above 5 6s. To do that, I could either increase the quantity to 6 something, or keep the same quantity but a higher digit. Let's think. If I go for 5 7s, that's a higher digit but same quantity. But I have one 7 in my hand. The opponent might have some 7s too. Not sure. Alternatively, bidding 6 of a lower digit might be better. But since the current bid is 5 6s, the next bid could be 5 7s, 5 8s, 5 9s, or 6 anything. \n\nWait, the rules say the bid must be strictly higher. So either higher quantity, or same quantity but higher digit. So 5 7s is valid because the digit is higher. But if I choose to bid 5 7s, I'm claiming there are at least 5 7s in total. Since I have one 7, the opponent would need at least 4 more. But since they have 8 digits, possible but maybe risky. Alternatively, going to a higher quantity like 6 of any digit. Let's see, maybe a digit I have more of. Looking at my hand: digits are 0,5,1,2,3,9,3,7. The counts are: 0 (1), 1 (1), 2 (1), 3 (2), 5 (1), 7 (1), 9 (1). So the highest count I have is two 3s. So if I bid 6 3s, that would require the opponent to have 4 more 3s. That's possible but maybe unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe challenging is better here. Since the current bid is 5 6s, and I have zero 6s. The opponent has to have at least 5 6s in their hand. Since they have 8 digits, having 5 6s would leave 3 other digits. Maybe possible, but maybe not. The total possible 6s in both hands can't exceed 8 (since I have none). Wait, no: total digits are 16 (each has 8). If the opponent has 5 6s, total would be 5. The bid is 5 6s, so that's exactly meeting the bid. But the bid requires at least that. So if the opponent has exactly 5, then the bid is valid. But if they have less, then the bid is wrong. Since I have 0, their count must be at least 5. So if they have 5, 6, 7, or 8 6s. But having 5 in their 8 digits is possible. But maybe the player is bluffing. \n\nHmm, challenging might be a good move here because the bid is 5 6s. If I challenge, and they have 5 or more, I lose. But if they have less, I win. The chance depends on their possible hand. Since they bid 5 6s, maybe they have some 6s. Let me think: if I have zero, and they have, say, 3 6s, then total is 3, which is less than 5. So challenging would win. But if they have 5, then it's exactly 5, so bid holds. So there's a 50/50 chance? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can bid higher. Let's see, what's the best bid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should bid 5 7s. Since I have one 7, and if the opponent has some, maybe it's possible. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, go to a higher quantity. Like 6 of a digit I have at least one of. Let's see, maybe 6 3s. Since I have two 3s. So if I bid 6 3s, then the opponent needs to have four 3s. Possible but maybe unlikely. Alternatively, maybe bid 6 of a digit I don't have. Like 6 6s. But that's risky since I have zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest is to challenge. Because the opponent's bid of 5 6s requires that they have at least 5 6s. Since I have zero, their hand must have 5 or more. But with 8 digits, 5 is possible. But maybe the opponent is overbidding. For example, if they have 3 6s, then the total is 3. So challenging could be a good call here, especially if I think they might be bluffing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the bid of 5 6s is reasonable. Let me think: the opponent might have multiple 6s. But since I have none, maybe they have 5. So challenging might be risky. Alternatively, making a higher bid. \n\nWait, the current bid is 5 6s. To outbid, I can either go to 6 any digit or 5 of a higher digit. Let's consider 5 7s. Since I have one 7, maybe I can guess that the opponent has some 7s. But maybe not. Alternatively, 5 8s. Since I have none. Hmm, maybe that's worse. \n\nAlternatively, going with 6 of a lower digit. Let's see, maybe 6 5s. I have one 5. If I bid 6 5s, then the opponent would need 5 more. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best option is to challenge because the bid of 5 6s is a bit high. Since the opponent has 8 digits, they could have up to 8 6s, but getting 5 would take half their hand. Maybe they might not have that many. So challenging might be better. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 5 7s, maybe that's a safer bet. Since I have one, and maybe the opponent has a couple. \n\nHmm, tough choice. Let me think again. The current bid is 5 6s. The opponent could have 5, but maybe they're bluffing. If I challenge and they have exactly 5, then I lose. But if they have less, I win. Since I have zero, their count must be at least 5. So if they have 5, then challenge loses. But if they have 4 or less, challenge wins. So the question is, do I think they have 5 or more? If I think it's unlikely, challenge. \n\nAlternatively, if I can make a bid that's safer. Let's see, what's the minimal bid. To outbid 5 6s, I can choose 5 7s. Let's say I bid 5 7s. Then, the total 7s must be at least 5. I have one, so the opponent needs at least 4. If they have, say, three, then total is 4, which is under. But maybe they have some. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to challenge. Since I have zero 6s, the opponent's bid requires them to have at least 5. That's a high number. Maybe they only have 3 or 4. So challenging could be better. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bid of 5 6s is reasonable. Maybe they have five 6s. Then challenging would lose. \n\nHmm. Since I have to choose, maybe challenging is better here because the bid seems high. Let's go with that."
