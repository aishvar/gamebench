Bidding on a digit I hold multiple times is a good strategy. I hold two 4s. Bidding '3 4s' is a reasonable opening bid. It asserts some strength based on my hand (having two 4s) and requires the opponent to have only one 4 for the bid to be true, which is statistically plausible.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 4\"\n}\n```",
