You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to make the first bid here since the current bid is None. My hand is 56508988. Let me look at the digits I have. Breaking it down:\n\nDigits in my hand: 5, 6, 5, 0, 8, 9, 8, 8. \n\nLet me count each digit:\n\n- 0: 1\n- 5: 2 (positions 1 and 3)\n- 6: 1\n- 8: 3 (positions 5,7,8)\n- 9: 1\n\nSo the most common in my hand are the 8s with three. Since I have three 8s, maybe I can bid higher. But since I'm starting, I need to consider what a reasonable first bid is. The opponent has 8 digits as well, so total digits are 16. \n\nThe first bid can be anything, but to be safe, maybe start with a digit I have a decent amount of. Since I have three 8s, maybe bid 3 8s. But wait, the bid has to be higher than the previous. Since there's no previous, I can choose any. Alternatively, maybe go higher to set a higher bar. But if I bid 3 8s, that's a starting point. Alternatively, maybe 4 8s? But I only have three. Hmm, but in Liar's Poker, you can bluff. But since I'm the first player, maybe being conservative is better. Wait, but the bid has to be a valid move. The first bid can be any quantity and digit, but the next player has to top it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 3 9s? But I only have one 9. That might be a bluff. But maybe starting with a higher digit could be better. Let me think. The digit's value also matters because if I choose a higher digit, even with the same quantity, it's a valid higher bid. Since the first bid can be anything, perhaps starting with a higher digit might be better. Let me check the digits I have. \n\nLooking at my digits, the highest digit I have is 9, but I only have one. 8 is next, which I have three. Maybe bidding 3 8s is safer because I have three, so even if the opponent has none, the total is 3, so the bid is valid. But if I bid 3 9s, the total might be low. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a lower quantity but higher digit? Like 2 9s? But the quantity has to be higher than previous. Since it's first, maybe it's okay. Wait, the first bid can be any, but the next has to be higher. Let me think of the best opening bid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with 4 8s. Since I have three, maybe the opponent has at least one, making the total 4. That's possible. But that's a bit of a bluff. But maybe that's a good opening. \n\nAlternatively, maybe go with 3 8s. Since I have three, and if the opponent has at least zero, the bid is 3, so it's valid. But maybe starting with a higher number. \n\nAlternatively, considering other digits. The 5 appears twice in my hand. Maybe 3 5s? But I only have two. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a lower bid to see how the opponent reacts. But as the first move, starting too low might not be effective. \n\nWait, in Liar's Poker, the first bid can be anything. The key is to make a bid that's hard for the opponent to call, but also not too high that they can easily challenge. \n\nAlternatively, starting with 4 8s. Since I have three, maybe the opponent has one, so total is four. That's plausible. Let's see, the bid would be 4 8s. That's a reasonable starting bid. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 3 8s, that's safer but maybe the opponent can just increase the quantity. \n\nHmm. Let me think. The opponent might have some 8s, but I can't know. Starting with 4 8s might be a good move. Let me check the rules again. The bid must be higher than the previous. Since it's the first, any bid is allowed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 3 9s. But I only have one. That's risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 5 8s. But that's a high bid. Since there are 16 total digits, 5 is possible but maybe too high. \n\nWait, the maximum possible is 16, but realistically, getting 5 of a digit would require both players having several. Since I have three, maybe the opponent has two, making five. But maybe that's pushing it. \n\nAlternatively, starting with 4 8s seems reasonable. So the bid would be \"BID: 4 8s\". \n\nAlternatively, maybe even 3 9s, but that's a lower digit count? Wait, the digit's numerical value matters. For example, a bid of 3 9s is higher than 3 8s because 9 is higher. Wait, the rules say: a higher bid is either higher quantity, or same quantity and higher digit. \n\nWait, the rules say: \"higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\"\n\nSo, for the first bid, I can choose any. To maximize my chances, maybe pick a digit that I have some of, so that I have a base. Since I have three 8s, maybe bid 4 8s. That gives me a base of 3, so if the opponent has at least one, it's valid. Alternatively, maybe bid 3 8s, but that's just my count. But maybe starting higher is better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 3 9s. Since 9 is a higher digit, but I have only one. That might be risky. The opponent might challenge if they don't have any. \n\nAlternatively, go with the digit I have the most of, which is 8. So bid 4 8s. That way, even if the opponent has one, it's 4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 5 8s? That's a stretch, but possible. But with my three, maybe the opponent has two. \n\nHmm. Let's see. The safest starting bid would be to bid a quantity that's higher than what I have, but not too high. Since I have three 8s, bidding 4 8s gives a 1 in the opponent's hand. That's plausible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a lower bid to see if the opponent raises. But as the first move, starting with a bid that's believable but gives me some confidence. \n\nI think the best move is to bid 4 8s. So the action would be \"BID: 4 8s\". That way, I have a base of 3, so if the opponent has at least one, it's valid. If they have none, then the total is 3, so a challenge would lose for me. But maybe that's a risk worth taking. Alternatively, maybe bid 3 8s to be safe. But since it's the first bid, maybe starting higher is better to pressure the opponent. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 3 8s, the next player can just increase the quantity to 4, which would be a problem if they have none. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 4 8s. Let's go with that. So the reasoning would be something like, \"I have three 8s in my hand. Bidding 4 8s gives a plausible total, assuming the opponent has at least one. This sets a higher bid for the opponent to either challenge or raise.\"\n"
