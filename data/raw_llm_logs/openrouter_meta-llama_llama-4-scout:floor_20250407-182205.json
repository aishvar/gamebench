However, I can try to bid on a different digit. I have one '6', and there are 2 players, so the maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16. I will bid on a higher digit than '5', specifically '6', and claim I have at least 3 of them, which seems unlikely but could work if Player 0 doesn't have many '6's.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 6s\"\n}\n```",
