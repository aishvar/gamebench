My hand contains the digits: 1, 0, 3, 3, 5, 2, 7, 0. I have two 1s and two 0s, with other digits appearing once. To make a higher bid, I must either increase the quantity or the digit. Since the current bid is '2 1s', I can try to increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. I have two 0s and two 1s. Bidding on '2 0s' seems reasonable as it's a higher quantity of a single digit than '2 1s' if I consider the possibility that Player 0 might also have a 0, but not enough to make a higher bid on 1s than what Player 0 has already bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: Q D\"\n}\n```",
