To determine my next action, I need to analyze the bid. The bid '2 5s' implies that there are at least 2 fives across both players' hands. I have one '5', so the other player must have at least one '5'. I can either challenge the bid or make a higher bid. A higher bid can be made by either increasing the quantity or changing the digit to a higher one. Since I have one '3', I can consider bidding on '3's. There are potentially 2 '3's across both hands (one in my hand and potentially one in the other player's hand). I can bid '3 3s', which is a valid higher bid because '3' is greater than '2' (the quantity of '5s' bid).\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 3s\"\n}\n```",
