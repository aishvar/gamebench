        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 3 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '4 4s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 24.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 24 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

My hand is 90644752, which contains two 4s and no 5s or higher digits that would immediately help with a higher bid. I have to decide whether to increase the quantity or the digit. Since I have two 4s, it's likely that the total count of 4s is at least 6 (2 from each of the 3 players). Therefore, bidding 5 4s seems reasonable as it increases the quantity. However, I can also consider bidding 4 5s to keep the quantity the same but increase the digit. Given that I don't have any 5s, I'm taking a bit of a risk by bidding 4 5s, but it's still a relatively safe bet compared to bidding a much higher quantity. I'll choose to bid 4 5s.\", \"action\": \"BID: 4 5s\"}",
