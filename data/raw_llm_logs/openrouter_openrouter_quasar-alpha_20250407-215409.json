The current bid claims there are at least three 7s across both hands. Since I only have one, Player 1 must have at least two 7s for the bid to be valid. This is somewhat unlikely, as two or more 7s in eight digits is not common. Given the prior bids were on 4s and 6s, and now Player 1 has shifted to 7s, possibly bluffing, I believe challenging is the best move rather than raising to an unlikely 4 7s or switching digits.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
