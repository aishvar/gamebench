You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out my move in this Liar's Poker game. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nFirst, my hand is 22188903. Let me count the digits I have. Breaking it down: 2, 2, 1, 8, 8, 9, 0, 3. So, I have two 2s, one 1, two 8s, one 9, one 0, and one 3. That means in my hand, I have two 8s and one 9. \n\nLooking at the bid history, Player 0 started with 2 7s, then Player 1 went up to 2 8s, and now Player 0 has bid 2 9s. My turn is next, so I need to decide whether to bid higher or challenge.\n\nThe current bid is 2 9s. To make a valid bid, I need to either increase the quantity or the digit. If I increase the digit, the next possible digit is 9, but since the current bid is already 9s, the only way is to increase the quantity. So, the next bid could be 3 9s or higher, or 2 9s with a higher digit, but 9 is the highest digit, so that's not possible.\n\nNow, considering the total number of digits in play, each player has 8 digits, so total is 16. The current bid is 2 9s, which is a low number. If I have one 9 in my hand, that leaves possibly one more 9 in Player 0's hand. But the bid is 2 9s, so it's possible.\n\nBut wait, I also have two 8s. Maybe I can bid on 8s instead. Since the current bid is 2 9s, I could bid 3 8s, which would be a higher bid because 3 is more than 2, and 8 is less than 9, but quantity takes precedence. However, I have two 8s, so if I bid 3 8s, that would mean there's at least one more 8 in Player 0's hand. Is that likely?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should challenge. The current bid is 2 9s. If I challenge and it's called, the count of 9s will be revealed. If there are fewer than 2, I win. If there are 2 or more, Player 0 wins. Considering that I have one 9, Player 0 could have one or two. If they have two, the bid is correct. If they have only one, then the bid is wrong, and I win by challenging.\n\nBut challenging is risky because if the bid is correct, I lose. So, I need to assess the likelihood. Since the bid is 2 9s, and I have one, Player 0 could have one or two. If they have two, the bid is correct. If they have one, it's incorrect. So, it's a 50-50 chance. But in Liar's Poker, players often try to trick each other, so maybe Player 0 is bluffing.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 8s. I have two, so I'm assuming there's at least one more in Player 0's hand. If they have one, then the total is three, making my bid correct. If they don't, then my bid is wrong, and I lose.\n\nHmm, which option is better? Challenging is risky because if Player 0 actually has two 9s, I lose. Bidding 3 8s is also risky because if Player 0 doesn't have an 8, then my bid is wrong. But considering the bid history, Player 0 went from 7s to 9s, which might indicate they're trying to bluff. Maybe they don't have many 9s.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 9s with a higher digit, but since 9 is the highest, that's not possible. So, the next bid would have to be 3 9s. But I only have one 9, so that's a big assumption. Maybe Player 0 doesn't have two 9s.\n\nWait, another thought: the current bid is 2 9s. I could bid 2 9s again but with a higher digit, but since 9 is the highest, that's not possible. So, I have to increase the quantity or the digit. Since the digit can't go higher, I have to increase the quantity. So, the next bid would be 3 9s.\n\nBut I have only one 9, so that's a big risk. If Player 0 has only one 9, then the total is two, making my bid of 3 9s incorrect. So, I might lose.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 8s. I have two, so I'm assuming Player 0 has at least one. If they do, then the bid is correct. If not, I lose.\n\nBut considering the bid history, Player 1 (me) previously bid 2 8s. Then Player 0 went to 2 9s. Maybe Player 0 is trying to bluff, thinking I don't have more 8s. But I do have two 8s, so maybe I can go higher on 8s.\n\nWait, but the current bid is 2 9s, so I can't bid 2 8s again because it's lower. I have to bid higher. So, 3 8s is higher than 2 9s because 3 is more than 2, even though 8 is less than 9.\n\nSo, I think bidding 3 8s is a better move. I have two 8s, and if Player 0 has at least one, the total is three. If they don't, then my bid is wrong. But given that I have two, it's reasonable to assume they might have at least one.\n\nAlternatively, challenging is also an option. If I challenge, and the count is less than 2, I win. If it's 2 or more, I lose. Considering that I have one 9, Player 0 could have one or two. If they have two, the bid is correct. If they have one, it's incorrect. So, it's a gamble.\n\nBut in Liar's Poker, players often try to bluff, so maybe Player 0 is overbidding. I have one 9, so if they have one, the total is two, making their bid correct. If they have none, then the total is one, making their bid incorrect. But since they bid 2 9s, they might have two. So, challenging might not be the best move.\n\nTherefore, I think the better move is to bid 3 8s, increasing the quantity from 2 to 3, even though the digit is lower. This way, I'm making a higher bid based on quantity, which is allowed. I have two 8s, so I'm assuming Player 0 has at least one, making the total three.\n"
