        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let's see, my hand is 68943347. That means I have the digits 6, 8, 9, 4, 3, 3, 4, 7. Let me count how many of each digit I have.\n\nStarting with 0s: I don't have any. 1s: none. 2s: none. 3s: I have two of them. 4s: two as well. 5s: none. 6s: one. 7s: one. 8s: one. 9s: one. So, my digits are 3,3,4,4,6,7,8,9.\n\nThe current bid is None, which means this is the first bid of the game. I need to decide whether to make a bid or challenge, but since there's no previous bid, I can't challenge. So I have to make a bid.\n\nI remember that in Liar's Poker, you want to make a bid that's believable but also gives you a strategic advantage. Since I have two 3s and two 4s, maybe I can bid based on that. But I don't know what the other player has, so I have to be cautious.\n\nIf I bid on 3s, saying something like 2 3s, that's safe because I have two. But maybe I can go higher. The maximum possible for any digit is 16, but that's across both players. So if I have two 3s, the other player could have up to 14 more, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, but if I bid 2 3s, it's a low bid, and the opponent might challenge it. Alternatively, I could bid a higher quantity on a digit I have or maybe a higher digit with the same quantity.\n\nLooking at my digits, I have one 6, one 7, one 8, and one 9. Those are all high digits. If I bid on a higher digit, maybe the opponent is less likely to have many of them. For example, bidding on 6s. I have one 6, so if I bid 1 6s, that's safe, but maybe I can bid higher.\n\nBut if I bid 2 6s, and the opponent doesn't have any, then the total would be just one, and I'd lose if challenged. So maybe it's better to bid 1 6s. That seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid on 3s or 4s, which I have more of. Bidding 2 3s or 2 4s. Since 4 is a higher digit than 3, maybe 2 4s is a better bid because it's higher in both quantity and digit if needed later.\n\nWait, but the current bid is None, so any bid is acceptable as long as it's higher than None, which it is. So I can choose any digit and quantity. But I want to choose a bid that's likely to be true but also gives me flexibility.\n\nIf I bid 2 4s, that's a good starting point. It's a moderate bid, and since I have two 4s, the opponent could have zero or more. The total could be 2 or more. But if the opponent has none, then the total is exactly 2, which matches my bid. If they have one, it's 3, which is still higher than my bid. So it's a safe bet.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 4s, but that's riskier because I only have two. The opponent would need to have at least one more 4 for the total to be 3. If they don't, then challenging would make me lose. So maybe 2 4s is better.\n\nAnother option is to bid on a higher digit with a lower quantity. For example, 1 8s or 1 9s. These are high digits, so it's less likely the opponent has many. But since I only have one, if I bid 1 8s, and the opponent has none, the total is 1, which is exactly my bid. If they have one, it's 2, which is higher. So that's also safe.\n\nBut which is better? Bidding on 4s with a higher quantity or a higher digit with lower quantity. I think starting with a higher digit might be better because it's less likely the opponent has many of them, making the bid more likely to be true.\n\nSo, I could bid 1 8s or 1 9s. Let's go with 1 9s because 9 is the highest digit, and it's less likely the opponent has multiple. If I bid 1 9s, and the opponent has none, it's exactly 1, which is good. If they have one, it's 2, which is still higher than my bid. So it's a safe and strategic move.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 4s, which is also safe. But I think bidding on a higher digit gives me more flexibility in future bids because higher digits are less common. So I'll go with 1 9s.\n\nWait, but if I bid 1 9s and the opponent has two 9s, then the total is 3, which is higher than my bid, so I'm safe. If they have one, it's 2; if none, it's 1. So in all cases, the bid holds. That's a good move.\n\nSo, I think the best action is to bid 1 9s. It's a safe and strategic starting point.\n"
