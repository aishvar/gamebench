Since I have no 6s, Player 0 must be claiming that there are at least two 6s across both hands, implying they likely have both 6s themselves. That is plausible, but still somewhat risky. Alternatively, I can consider raising the bid. Since I have one 7, a bid of 2 7s is reasonable, as Player 0 could plausibly have at least one 7. This is a safer incremental bid compared to accepting the 2 6s claim, which I cannot support at all from my hand. Therefore, the best strategic move is to bid 2 7s, increasing the quantity on a digit I hold, rather than challenge immediately or bid on 6s I don't have.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 7s\"\n}",
