You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and I need to figure out my next move. Let me start by understanding the game state. \n\nFirst, my hand is 24104807. That means I have the digits 2, 4, 1, 0, 4, 8, 0, and 7. So, in my own hand, I have two 4s and two 0s. The other digits (2,1,8,7) are single each. \n\nThe current bid is 2 5s from Player 0. I need to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid. \n\nSince the current bid is 2 5s, my options are to either challenge it or bid higher. To challenge, I need to think if 2 5s is possible. But since I don't have any 5s in my hand, the total number of 5s depends entirely on what Player 0 has. Player 0 has 8 digits as well, and if they have at least two 5s, the bid is valid. But if they have less, then challenging would be good.\n\nAlternatively, I can make a higher bid. A higher bid can be either a higher quantity or the same quantity with a higher digit. Since the current bid is 2 5s, I can either bid 3 of any digit or 2 of a digit higher than 5. \n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 4s and two 0s. But 4 is lower than 5, so if I bid 2 4s, that's lower than 2 5s, so it's invalid. The same goes for 0s. So I can't bid 2 of a higher digit than 5 because I don't have any digits above 5 in my hand except for 7 and 8, which I only have one each. \n\nSo, the other option is to increase the quantity. I can try to bid 3 of a digit. Let's see which digits I have in sufficient quantity. I have two 4s and two 0s. So I can't bid 3 of any digit because I don't have three of any single digit. Therefore, I can't make a valid higher bid in terms of quantity because I don't have enough. \n\nSo, my options are limited. I can't make a higher bid because I don't have enough digits to support a higher quantity, and I don't have any digits higher than 5 to make a same-quantity bid. \n\nTherefore, the only viable option is to challenge the current bid of 2 5s. Since I don't have any 5s, I'm guessing that Player 0 might be bluffing. If the total number of 5s is less than 2, I win. But if Player 0 actually has two or more 5s, I lose. \n\nBut considering that in my hand there are no 5s, and Player 0 might have at most two 5s, it's a bit of a risk. However, since I can't make a higher bid, challenging seems like the only move. Plus, the initial bid was the minimum, so it's possible that Player 0 is trying to start low, but without knowing their hand, it's a gamble. \n\nSo, I think challenging is the best move here because I can't make a higher bid, and there's a chance that Player 0 doesn't have enough 5s.\n"
