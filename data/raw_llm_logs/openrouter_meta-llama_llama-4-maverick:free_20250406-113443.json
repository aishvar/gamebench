        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 4 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '5 5s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 32.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 32 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.",

                    "content": "To determine the best course of action, let's first analyze the given information:\n\n1. **Your Hand:** 55155882\n   - Counting the digits in your hand: \n     - 5 appears 4 times\n     - 1 appears 0 times\n     - 8 appears 3 times\n     - 2 appears 1 time\n\n2. **Current Bid:** 5 5s\n   - The bid is on the count of 5s, with a quantity of 5.\n\n3. **Your Turn:** It's your turn as Player 1.\n\nGiven the current bid is 5 5s, to make a higher bid, you need to either increase the quantity or keep the quantity the same and increase the digit.\n\nLet's analyze your hand:\n- You have 4 fives, so the total count of 5s across all players is at least 4. The current bid is 5 5s, which means there must be at least one more 5 among the other players' hands.\n\nTo make a higher bid than 5 5s, you could either bid a higher quantity with the same digit (e.g., 6 5s) or bid the same quantity with a higher digit (e.g., 5 6s).\n\n1. **Bidding Higher Quantity with the Same Digit (5s):**\n   - Bidding 6 5s implies there are at least 6 fives in total. Given you have 4 fives, there need to be at least 2 more fives among the other players. This is plausible but depends on the distribution.\n\n2. **Bidding Same Quantity with a Higher Digit:**\n   - You have 3 eights in your hand. The next higher digit than 5 is 6, but you don't have any 6s. The next higher digit is 8. Bidding 5 8s means you're asserting there are at least 5 eights in total.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n- **Bidding 6 5s:** This requires that there are at least 2 more 5s among the other players. It's a reasonable assertion given that Player 0 (who made the current bid) likely has at least one 5.\n- **Bidding 5 8s:** Given you have 3 eights, this bid implies there are at least 2 more eights among the other players. This is also a plausible scenario.\n\nBoth options seem viable, but let's directly compare them:\n- **6 5s** is a more conservative bid as it sticks with the same digit and only increases the quantity by 1. It's a relatively safe bid given the context that the previous player bid 5 5s and likely has some 5s.\n- **5 8s** changes the digit to 8 and keeps the quantity the same. Given you have 3 eights, it's a reasonable assertion that there could be 2 more eights among the other players.\n\nGiven these considerations, bidding **6 5s** seems like a cautious and reasonable step as it directly builds upon the existing bid without changing the digit. It implies a slight increase in the total count of 5s, which is plausible.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 5 5s. I have 4 fives in my hand, so there are at least 4 fives in total. Bidding 6 5s is a reasonable next step as it slightly increases the quantity, implying there's at least one more 5 among the other players, which is plausible given the previous bids and the fact that the bidder likely has at least one 5.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 6 5s\"\n}\n```",
