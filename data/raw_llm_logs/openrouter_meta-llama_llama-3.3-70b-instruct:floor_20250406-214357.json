        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '1 0s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

Since I have no 0s in my hand but do have repeated digits, I should consider bidding on a digit I have, aiming for a low quantity to minimize risk. Bidding on a digit I possess, like 1, 2, 3, 7, or 8, seems reasonable. Given the low current bid, increasing the quantity to 2 and choosing a digit I have multiple of, such as 1, 3, 7, or 8, would be a safe and logical next step. Among these, choosing '2 1s' seems like a balanced choice because it's a low digit and I have two 1s in my hand, but considering the need to balance risk and the potential for the other player to have 0s or other digits, I opt for a digit that is not too high but still reflects my hand's composition. Since I have two 7s and no 0s, and considering the other player might have 0s, bidding '2 7s' seems like a cautious yet progressive move, leveraging my hand's information without overextending into higher, riskier bids.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 7s\"\n}",
