The bidding history alternated between bidding on the current digit + 2 and then incrementing the digit. Since Player 1 bid 2 9s after I bid 2 4s, it suggests they might not have a strong hand in higher digits and could be bluffing or have a decent number of 9s. However, given that I have one '9', it's possible that the total count of '9's is at least 2. To make a higher bid, I need to bid on a higher quantity or a higher digit. The next higher digit is not an option as I'm already at '9', so I need to increase the quantity. Thus, I should bid 3 9s to stay in the game, as challenging might result in me losing if the other player indeed has at least 2 '9's.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 9s\"\n}\n```",
