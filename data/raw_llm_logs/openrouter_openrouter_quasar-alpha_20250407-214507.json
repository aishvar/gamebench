Since I have 2 zeros myself, Player 1 would only need to have at least 1 zero among their 8 digits for the bid to be valid. Given the probability \u2014 zeros appear roughly 1/10th of the time \u2014 it's quite likely Player 1 has at least one zero. Therefore, challenging now is risky. A safe move is to increase the bid slightly. The next minimal valid bid is '3 1s' (since the digit is higher), but I only see one '1' in my hand, making that uncertain. Alternatively, I can increase the count to 4 zeros. Since I have 2 zeros, Player 1 would need at least 2 zeros, which is less probable but still plausible. Given the uncertainty, bidding '4 0s' pressures Player 1 and avoids a risky challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 0\"\n}",
