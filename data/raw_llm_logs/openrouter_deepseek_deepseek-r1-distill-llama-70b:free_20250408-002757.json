        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '4 4s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Liar's Poker game. My hand is 13643093, which I can break down into individual digits: 1, 3, 6, 4, 3, 0, 9, 3. Let me count how many of each digit I have.\n\nLooking at my digits, I have three 3s, one 1, one 6, one 4, one 0, and one 9. So, the digits I have are: 0,1,3,3,3,4,6,9. That means I have three 3s, which is significant. \n\nThe current bid is 4 4s from Player 1. So, they're claiming that there are at least four 4s in total between both players. My task is to decide whether to challenge this bid or make a higher bid.\n\nFirst, I need to assess how likely it is that there are four 4s. I only have one 4 in my hand, so if Player 1 has three 4s, that would make four in total. But is that probable? Well, each player has eight digits, so Player 1 could have up to eight of any digit. But considering the game has been going on, the bids have been increasing in a pattern: 3 3s, 3 4s, 4 3s, and now 4 4s. \n\nI have three 3s, so when the bid was 4 3s, I could have potentially challenged that because I only have three, but I didn't. Now, the bid is 4 4s. I have one 4. If Player 1 has three 4s, that would make four. But is that a reasonable assumption?\n\nAlternatively, maybe Player 1 is bluffing. Since they just increased the quantity from 3 4s to 4 4s, perhaps they don't have enough 4s themselves. But I can't be sure. \n\nAnother approach is to think about the maximum possible. The total number of 4s can't exceed 16, but that's not helpful here. I need to consider what's more likely. Given that I have only one 4, Player 1 would need to have three. Is that possible? Yes, but is it likely? Maybe not, especially if they're trying to push the bid higher.\n\nIf I challenge, and the total is less than four, I win. If it's four or more, I lose. So, I need to decide whether the chance that the total 4s are less than four is higher than not.\n\nGiven that I have one 4, the maximum Player 1 can have is eight, but realistically, they probably don't have that many. Maybe they have two or three. If they have three, then the total is four. If they have two, the total is three, which would mean the bid is invalid.\n\nI'm leaning towards challenging because the bid seems a bit high, especially considering the progression. Also, since I have only one 4, it's possible that Player 1 is overestimating. However, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I could try to bid higher, but I don't have enough of any digit except 3s, and the current bid is on 4s, so I can't go higher on 3s without changing the digit, which would require a higher quantity or digit.\n\nWait, if I try to bid higher, I could go for 5 of a higher digit, but I don't have enough of any digit except 3s, and the current digit is 4. So, I can't go higher on 3s because the digit is lower than 4. So, the only way to bid higher is to either increase the quantity on 4s or choose a higher digit with the same or higher quantity.\n\nI don't have enough 5s, 6s, etc., to make a bid. So, my options are limited. Therefore, challenging might be the better option here because I can't make a higher bid that's reasonable based on my hand.\n\nSo, I think challenging is the way to go because the bid of 4 4s seems unlikely given my hand, and I can't make a higher bid without more information.\n"
