        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to make the first bid here because the current bid is None. The user's hand is 04096962. Let me look at that. The digits in my hand are 0,4,0,9,6,9,6,2. Let me count each digit:\n\n- 0 appears twice.\n- 4 once.\n- 9 twice.\n- 6 twice.\n- 2 once.\n\nSo the counts in my hand are: 0(2), 4(1), 9(2), 6(2), 2(1). Since the opponent has 8 digits too, the total possible for any digit can be up to 16, but realistically, the total counts depend on what the other player has.\n\nSince I'm first to bid, I need to choose a digit that I can reasonably claim a higher quantity than what's likely. Let's see which digits I have multiple of. The 0, 9, and 6 each have two in my hand. \n\nStarting with 0: I have two. Maybe the opponent has some 0s, but maybe not many. If I bid 3 0s, that would require there to be at least one more 0 in their hand. But since I have two, maybe that's possible, but maybe not the best choice. \n\nLooking at 9s: I have two. If I bid 3 9s, same logic. The opponent might have one or two 9s. \n\n6s: same as above. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a higher digit might be better. The highest digit I have multiple of is 9, so maybe starting with a higher digit could be better. Since when bidding, you can increase either quantity or digit. Since the first bid can be anything, but to make it strong, maybe start with a higher digit but a moderate quantity. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 2 9s, but since the bid has to be higher than 'None', the first bid can be any starting point. Wait, the rules say the first bid can be any valid bid, but subsequent bids must be higher. Since the current bid is None, the first bid just needs to be a valid bid (quantity from 1 to 16, digit 0-9). \n\nBut to make a good opening bid, maybe start with a digit that I have, so that I have some basis. Since I have two 9s, maybe bid 3 9s. That way, if the opponent doesn't have any 9s, then the total is 2, which would make the bid invalid. But maybe that's risky. Alternatively, maybe bid 2 9s, but since the bid has to be the first, but the rules say that the next bid must be higher. Wait, the first bid can be anything, but the next player has to top it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a lower quantity but a higher digit. For example, 2 9s. But since it's the first bid, maybe starting with a slightly higher quantity and a good digit. Let me think of common strategies. Usually, starting with a bid that's just one more than what you have, to make it plausible. Since I have two 9s, bidding 3 9s might be a good start. Alternatively, maybe go for a digit that's more common, but I don't know the opponent's hand. \n\nAlternatively, maybe pick a digit that's less likely to be challenged immediately. Maybe 6s? I have two of those. Bidding 3 6s. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher digit but a lower quantity. Like 2 9s. But then the next player could easily raise it. Maybe better to set a higher initial bid to put pressure. \n\nAlternatively, since the first bid is often a 4 or 5, but I have to start somewhere. Let me see. Since I have two 9s, maybe bid 3 9s. That way, if the opponent doesn't have any, then the total is 2, so a challenge would win for me. But if they have one, then total is 3, which meets the bid. If they have two, it's 4, so the bid is okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 2 9s. But then the next player could raise to 3 9s or 2 of a higher digit. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe pick a digit I have two of, and bid 3 of that. Let's go with 9s. So, bid 3 9s. That seems reasonable. The opponent might have some, but it's a strong starting point. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid a higher quantity but a lower digit. Wait, but the first bid is mine, so I can choose. Let me confirm the rules again. The first bid can be any valid bid. Since I have two 9s, bidding 3 9s is a good start. Let's go with that. \n\nSo the action would be BID: 3 9s. The reasoning is that I have two 9s, so bidding 3 9s gives a plausible chance that the opponent has at least one more, making the total valid. It's a higher digit, which is better because if someone wants to raise, they can either go to 4 9s or 3 of a higher digit. Starting with 3 9s sets the stage. \n\nAlternatively, maybe start with a higher digit but lower quantity? Like 1 9s, but that's too low. No, better to go higher. Yeah, 3 9s seems good. Let me make sure there's no better option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 4 6s? Since I have two 6s, but 4 might be too high. But maybe possible. But 3 9s is safer. \n\nOkay, I'll go with 3 9s. That's my bid.\n"
