For this bid to be true, Player 1 must hold at least two '6's (3 total - 1 in my hand = 2 needed from Player 1). While possible, requiring two specific digits from the opponent's 8-digit hand is a reasonable point to consider challenging. However, I have two '4's and two '5's in my hand. My previous bid was '3 5s'. Instead of challenging a relatively low bid, I can make a stronger bid based on my hand. Bidding '4 4s' is a valid next bid. This bid leverages my holding of two '4's and requires Player 1 to have at least two '4's for the bid to be accurate. This puts pressure back on the opponent and is based on the stronger part of my hand, potentially pushing the quantity higher towards a more likely challenge point later.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 4s\"\n}\n```",
