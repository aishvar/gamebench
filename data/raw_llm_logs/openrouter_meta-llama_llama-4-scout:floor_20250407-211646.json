The current bid is 4 zeros. Looking at my hand: 96943678, I count 2 zeros. I do not have enough information about Player 0's hand, but I can calculate the potential for a higher bid. If I bid on a digit that appears frequently in my hand, I might be able to make a credible bid. My hand contains 2 zeros, 1 fours, 1 six, 1 seven, 1 eight, 1 nine, and 2 nines are not present but 1 nine is. The digit '9' appears once in my hand. Given that the last bid was on '0s' and I have only 2 zeros, bidding on a different digit might be safer. However, I must consider if bidding higher on '0s' or switching to another digit is more strategic. Since I have 1 nine and the previous bid was about zeros, I could try to bid on nines or another digit. But first, let's evaluate the challenge option.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 5 9s\"\n}\n```",
