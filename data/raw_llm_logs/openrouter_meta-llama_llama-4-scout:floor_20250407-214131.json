Since the bid is on the quantity of 8s and I also have two 8s, I can bid higher on 8s or switch to another digit. I choose to bid on 8s because I have two of them, matching the quantity of the current bid but not exceeding it. However, I can try to bid on 7s as I have two of them.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 7s\"\n}\n```",
