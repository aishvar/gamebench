Since I have two, this implies the opponent likely has at least one 8. This is plausible, making a challenge risky. To continue, I can make a minimal valid raise by increasing the count of 8s to 4, or by bidding 3 of a higher digit (9s). However, 4 8s would require the opponent to have at least two 8s, which is less probable. Alternatively, I can increase the digit with the same count. Looking at my hand, I have two 3s as well. Bidding 3 9s would be speculative; instead, raising to 4 3s is less supported as I only have two. The safest minimal raise is 3 9s, but with no 9s in my hand, it is a bluff. Given that, challenging now is safer since 3 8s is plausible but 4 8s is unlikely. Therefore, the optimal move is to challenge the current bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
