For the total to be at least 3, the opponent would need to have at least two 7s. Since each player has 8 digits, the total maximum sevens is 16, but statistically, having 3 or more is plausible. It's risky to challenge this early on a 3-count bid. A safer strategy is to increase the bid slightly to maintain pressure. I can raise the quantity to 4 for a lower digit that I have multiple of, but I only have one 5, one 6, two 0s, two 5s, one 9, one 2, one 7, and one 1. I have two 5s, so bidding 4 5s is reasonable, assuming the opponent has at least two 5s. Alternatively, I can bid 4 7s, but since I only have one 7, that's riskier. Therefore, I'll increase the bid to 4 5s.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 5s\"\n}",
