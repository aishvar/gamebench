        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 0s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

Considering the bidding rules, to make a higher bid, I must either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit with the same or higher quantity. Since I have two 0s and no information about the other player's hand, bidding on a higher digit seems more reasonable. Looking at my hand, I see I have one 4, one 6, one 7, one 5, and two 8s. The highest digit I can bid on with confidence, given I don't know the other player's hand, would be the 8, but since I only have two 8s, I need to consider if bidding '2 8s' would be a safe move, given it's the highest digit I can confidently bid on without overestimating. However, since my goal is to make a bid that is strictly higher than '2 0s' and considering the digits available in my hand, bidding on '2 8s' seems like a viable option because it keeps the quantity the same but increases the digit, adhering to the rules for a higher bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 8s\"\n}",
