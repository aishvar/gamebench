Since I have no 5s, for the bid to be valid, the opponent must have both 5s in their hand, which is possible but somewhat unlikely. However, it's still early in bidding, and 2 of any digit is a very conservative bid, so challenging now is risky. Instead, I can safely increase the bid with a digit I have multiple of. I have two 8s and two 2s. Bidding 3 2s or 3 8s would be a significant jump, but a minimal safe increase is to bid 2 6s, since I have one 6, and it's plausible the opponent has at least one. Alternatively, I can bid 2 8s, since I have two. But since 2 5s is the current bid, the minimal higher bid would be 2 6s (higher digit, same quantity). This is a safe incremental bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 6\"\n}",
