        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 5s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

                    "reasoning": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let's see, I have the hand 88574097. That means my digits are 8, 8, 5, 7, 4, 0, 9, 7. So, I have two 8s, two 7s, one 5, one 4, one 0, and one 9. \n\nThe current bid is 2 5s from Player 0. I need to decide whether to challenge or make a higher bid. To challenge, I have to think if 2 5s is a reasonable bid. Since I have one 5 in my hand, the total number of 5s could be one or more, depending on what Player 0 has. But since the maximum is 16 digits in total, the number of 5s can't be more than 16, but that's a wide range.\n\nIf I challenge, and the total number of 5s is 2 or more, I lose. If it's less than 2, I win. But I only have one 5, so Player 0 must have at least one 5 for the bid to be correct. But I don't know their hand. \n\nAlternatively, I can make a higher bid. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since the current bid is 2 5s, a higher quantity would be 3 of any digit, or the same quantity but a higher digit, like 2 6s. \n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 8s and two 7s. So, I can bid 2 8s, which is a higher digit than 5. That seems safe because I have two 8s, and even if Player 0 has none, the total would be two, meeting the bid. Or I could bid 3 of a digit I have at least three of, but I don't have three of any digit. So 2 8s seems like a solid move because it's higher than 2 5s, and I can back it up with my own hand.\n\nI think challenging is risky because Player 0 might have at least one 5, making the total 2 or more. So, it's safer to bid 2 8s instead of challenging.\n"
