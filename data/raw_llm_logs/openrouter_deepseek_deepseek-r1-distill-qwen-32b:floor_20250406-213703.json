        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '1 9s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Liar's Poker game. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, I look at my hand: 09804968. That's eight digits. Let me count how many of each digit I have:\n\n- 0: I see two 0s.\n- 9: There are two 9s.\n- 8: There's one 8.\n- 4: One 4.\n- 6: One 6.\n\nSo, focusing on the digit 9s, I have two of them. The current bid is 1 9s made by Player 0. My goal is to either make a higher bid or challenge if I think it's too high.\n\nSince the bid is 1 9s, I can challenge it if I think the total number of 9s is less than 1. But wait, I have two 9s myself. That means even if Player 0 doesn't have any, the total is at least two. So challenging would be risky because the actual count is definitely higher than 1.\n\nAlternatively, I can make a higher bid. To be higher, I can either increase the quantity or keep the same quantity but choose a higher digit. Since the current bid is 1 9s, the next move could be:\n\n1. Increase the quantity to 2 9s. That would be a valid higher bid because 2 is more than 1.\n2. Or, keep the quantity at 1 but choose a higher digit than 9, but there are no digits higher than 9. So the only option is to increase the quantity.\n\nGiven that I have two 9s, I can confidently bid 2 9s. This is a safe move because the total number of 9s is at least two, and it's a higher bid than the current one. Plus, since I have two, I know the actual count is at least that, making my bid valid.\n\nI think this is the best move because it's a logical next step, and I have the necessary digits to support it. Challenging would be a bad idea here because the bid is too low compared to the actual count, and I would lose the challenge.\n"
