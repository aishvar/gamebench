        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 4s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the best move in this Liar's Poker game. Let's start by analyzing the situation.\n\nFirst, I have the hand 60507299. Let me count the digits: 6, 0, 5, 0, 7, 2, 9, 9. So, I have two 0s, two 9s, and one each of 6, 5, 7, and 2.\n\nThe current bid is 2 4s, made by Player 0. My goal is to either make a higher bid or challenge if I think it's unlikely.\n\nLooking at the digits, I don't have any 4s in my hand. So, the total number of 4s in both hands can't exceed 8 (since each player has 8 digits). But since I have none, the maximum possible is 8, but it's more likely that there are fewer.\n\nConsidering the current bid is 2 4s, I need to decide if challenging is a good move. If I challenge and the actual count is less than 2, I win. If it's 2 or more, Player 0 wins.\n\nGiven that I don't have any 4s, I can assume that Player 0 might be bluffing. It's possible they have a few 4s, but it's also possible they don't. Challenging here could be risky because if Player 0 actually has 2 or more 4s, they win. But if they don't, I win.\n\nAlternatively, I could make a higher bid. The next possible bid would be either increasing the quantity to 3 or keeping the quantity the same but choosing a higher digit. Let's see:\n\n- If I choose a higher digit, say 3 5s, but I only have one 5. It's possible Player 0 has some 5s, but I'm not sure. Bidding 3 5s might be risky if Player 0 doesn't have enough.\n- Alternatively, I could bid 3 4s, but that's only increasing the quantity by one. I don't have any 4s, so I'm not sure about that.\n\nAnother option is to bid on a digit I have more of. I have two 0s and two 9s. Maybe bidding 3 0s or 3 9s could be a good move. But I only have two of each, so I'm not certain if the total would be higher.\n\nConsidering all this, challenging seems like a viable option because the bid is relatively low (2 4s), and I don't have any 4s. It's possible that Player 0 is bluffing, especially since 4s are a lower digit and might be less likely to be held onto.\n\nHowever, I should also consider the risk. If Player 0 actually has two 4s, I lose. But given that I don't have any, the chance that both players have exactly two 4s is low. It's more probable that the total number is less than 2, especially if Player 0 is trying to bluff.\n\nSo, after weighing the options, I think challenging the bid is the best move here. It's a calculated risk, but given the information I have, it seems like a good play.\n"
