        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid 'None'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to make the first bid in this Liar's Poker game. My hand is 25758906. Let me list out the digits I have: 2, 5, 7, 5, 8, 9, 0, 6. So, counting each digit:\n\n- 0: 1\n- 2: 1\n- 5: 2\n- 6: 1\n- 7: 1\n- 8: 1\n- 9: 1\n\nThe other player has 8 digits as well, so the total possible for any digit is up to 16. Since the current bid is None, I have to start. My goal is to make a bid that's plausible but also leaves room for the opponent to overbid, but maybe not too strong. \n\nStarting with the highest count in my hand is 2 fives. If I bid 3 5s, that's possible because I have two, so maybe the opponent has one. Alternatively, maybe pick a digit I have and bid a little higher. But since I'm first, maybe go with a lower quantity to not be too aggressive. Wait, but the bid has to be strictly higher than the current (which is none), so any bid is allowed. The first bid can be anything, right? \n\nAlternatively, maybe pick a digit that's common? But since I have two 5s, maybe bid 3 5s. That seems reasonable. Alternatively, maybe start with a lower digit to make it easier? Hmm, but I want to choose a bid that's hard for the opponent to challenge. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid 2 of a digit I have, but since it's the first bid, maybe better to go a bit higher. Let's see, I have two 5s. If I bid 3 5s, then the opponent might have to either raise the quantity or the digit. Alternatively, if I pick a digit I have none of, but that's risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid on a digit I have, but with a higher count. Since I have two 5s, maybe bid 3 5s. The opponent has 8 digits, so total could be 2 plus whatever they have. If they have at least one 5, then the total is 3. So that's a safe bid. Alternatively, maybe bid 3 of a lower digit? Like 3 2s? But I only have one 2. That might be riskier. \n\nAlternatively, bid on a digit I have, but with a slightly higher count. Let's see. The safest might be 3 5s. Alternatively, 2 5s but that's the minimum. Since the bid has to be the first, maybe go with 3 5s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe pick a higher digit to make it easier to raise later. Like, bid 3 8s? But I have only one 8. The opponent might have some, but maybe that's riskier. \n\nHmm, perhaps starting with a mid-range bid. Let's go with 3 5s. That's a reasonable first bid. So the action should be BID: 3 5s. \n\nWait, but I have two 5s. If the opponent has none, the total would be 2, which is less than 3, so challenging would win. But as the first bidder, I have to consider that. Maybe I should bid 2 5s? But then the next player can easily raise. Since the bid has to be higher than None, any bid is allowed. Maybe the best first move is to bid a low quantity but on a high digit. Like 1 9s? But that's too low. Alternatively, 3 of a lower digit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid 2 9s since I have one 9. The opponent might have one, making the total 2. But if I bid 3, then if they have none, it's a problem. \n\nHmm, perhaps starting with 3 5s is better because I have two, so even if the opponent has one, it's exactly 3. So that's a safe bid. Alternatively, maybe bid 4 5s. But that's riskier. \n\nWait, the first bid can be anything, so maybe starting with a moderate bid. Let's go with 3 5s. That's the highest count I have. So the action would be BID: 3 5s."
