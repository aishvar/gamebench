In my hand, I have only one '1'. To reach the total of three '1's, Player 0 would need to have at least two '1's in their hand. This is plausible, as it is not an overly high bid at this stage of the game. Challenging this bid would be risky because it is reasonable for Player 0 to have two or more '1's. Instead, I will raise the bid to 4 1s, as this is a natural progression and keeps the game moving while putting pressure on Player 0.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 1s\"\n}\n```",
