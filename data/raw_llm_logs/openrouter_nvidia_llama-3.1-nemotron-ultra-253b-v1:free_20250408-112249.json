        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '3 9s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'.

However, the total number of 9s could be low. Since the bid is 3 9s, and I have none, the total would be whatever the opponent has. If they have 3 or more, it's risky. But considering they started with 1 9s, then I bid 2 8s, and they raised to 3 9s, they might be bluffing. The max quantity is 16, but digits are 0-9. To make a higher bid, I can either increase the quantity or the digit. Since the current digit is 9, the highest possible, I can't go higher in digit. So I must increase the quantity. The next possible bid is 4 of any digit. Looking at my hand, I have two 8s and two 1s. If I bid 4 8s, that's possible if the opponent has at least two 8s. But I can't be sure. Alternatively, bidding 4 of a lower digit might be safer, but the quantity must be higher. Since 8 is the highest digit I have multiple of, bidding 4 8s could be a good move, assuming the opponent might have some. However, challenging might be better here because if the opponent only has one 9, then 3 9s would fail. But since they raised their own bid from 1 to 3, they might have at least two 9s, making the total 2 (if I have none). Wait, but if I have none, and they have two, that's only two, which is less than 3. So their bid of 3 9s would be a bluff. Therefore, challenging could win. But if they have three 9s, then I lose. Considering the risk, maybe it's better to challenge here, given that the opponent might be overextending from 1 to 3, possibly bluffing.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}",
