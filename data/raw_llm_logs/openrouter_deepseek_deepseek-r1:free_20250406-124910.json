You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins.

                    "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out whether to bid higher or challenge the current bid of 2 sixes. My hand is 80247981. Let me check how many sixes I have. Looking at my digits: 8, 0, 2, 4, 7, 9, 8, 1. Hmm, no sixes here. So I have zero sixes. The opponent bid 2 sixes. Since there are two players, each with 8 digits, the total possible digits are 16. The current bid is 2 sixes. If I challenge, we'll check how many sixes there are in total. Since I have none, the opponent must have at least two sixes in their hand for the bid to be valid. But if the opponent is bluffing, maybe they don't have that many. \n\nBut wait, the opponent is Player 0, and they made the first bid. They might have some sixes. Let's think about possible strategies. If they have, say, two sixes, then the total is two, which meets the bid. If they have one, then total is one, which is less than two, so challenging would win. If they have none, same thing. But how likely is that?\n\nSince the bid is 2 sixes, which is a low quantity, it's possible they have at least one or two. But since I have none, the total is whatever they have. If I challenge now, there's a 50-50 chance they have two or more. But maybe it's better to bid higher instead. Let's see what options I have. The current bid is 2 6s. To bid higher, I can either increase the quantity (like 3 of any digit) or keep the quantity the same but increase the digit (like 2 7s, 8s, 9s). \n\nLooking at my hand, I have two 8s (digits 8 and 8), one 0, 2, 4, 7, 9, 1. So maybe I can bid on 8s. For example, bid 2 8s. Since the current bid is 2 6s, 8 is higher than 6, so 2 8s would be a valid higher bid. That way, I can pass the challenge to the opponent. But wait, the total number of 8s in the game would be my two plus whatever the opponent has. If I bid 2 8s, and the opponent has, say, one 8, then total is three, which is more than two. But if they have none, then total is two, which meets the bid. So if I bid 2 8s, the opponent might challenge if they have none. But since I have two, the total is at least two. So that's a safe bid. Alternatively, I could bid higher in quantity. For example, 3 of a lower digit. But since I have no sixes, maybe that's risky. Let's see. If I bid 3 5s, that's higher in quantity. But I don't know how many 5s are out there. Since I have none, the opponent would need at least three 5s. That's possible but maybe unlikely. Alternatively, bid 2 9s. I have one 9. So total would be my one plus opponent's. If they have at least one, then total is two. But if they have none, then total is one, which is less than two. So that's risky. \n\nAlternatively, bid 2 8s. Since I have two, the total is at least two. So that's a safe bid because even if the opponent has none, the total is two, which meets the bid. Therefore, bidding 2 8s is a valid and safe move. That way, I can pass the challenge risk to the opponent. If they challenge, they'll see that there are at least two 8s (from my hand), so I win. If they don't challenge, they have to bid higher. So this seems like a good strategy. \n\nAlternatively, if I challenge now, the total sixes would be whatever the opponent has. Since I have none, if they have two or more, they win. If they have less, I win. But since the bid is low (2), it's possible they have at least one or two. If they have two, challenging would lose. If they have one, I win. But without knowing their hand, it's a gamble. Maybe it's safer to bid 2 8s, which I know is a valid bid, and force them to either challenge or bid higher. \n\nSo the best move is to bid 2 8s. That's a higher digit than 6, same quantity, so it's a valid higher bid. And since I have two 8s, the total is at least two, making the bid truthful. Therefore, I should choose to bid 2 8s.\n"
