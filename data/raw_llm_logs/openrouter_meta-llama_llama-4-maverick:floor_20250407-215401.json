My hand is 92867611, which contains one '6' and no '4's. The bid history started with 2 4s by Player 0, then I bid 2 6s, and Player 0 responded with 3 4s. To make a higher bid, I need to either increase the quantity or bid on a higher digit. Since I don't have any '4's, I should consider the likelihood of '4's in Player 0's hand and the total count. Given that Player 0 initially bid 2 4s and then increased it to 3 4s after my bid on '6's, it suggests they might have a reasonable count of '4's. However, I have to make a decision based on my hand and the information available. I can either challenge the bid if I think it's unlikely or make a higher bid. Since I don't have any '4's, and there are 8 cards in each hand, it's plausible that both hands together have at least 3 '4's, especially if Player 0 has some. My hand has one '6', so the total count of '6's could be at least 2 (one in my hand and potentially one in Player 0's hand), but bidding 2 7s or higher would be a safer bet as it exceeds the current bid and I can reasonably assume the presence of some '7's or higher digits in both hands. I will bid on a higher digit to exceed the current bid.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 3 7s\"\n}\n```",
