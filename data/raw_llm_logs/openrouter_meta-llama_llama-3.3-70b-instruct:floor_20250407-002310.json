        "developer_message": "Liar's Poker Rules:\n- Each of the 2 players has 8 secret digits.\n- Players take turns bidding on the total count of a specific digit (0-9) across ALL players' hands.\n- A bid consists of a quantity and a digit (e.g., '3 5s' means at least three 5s exist in total).\n- Your bid must be strictly higher than the current bid '2 0s'.\n  - 'Higher' means: higher quantity (e.g., 3 9s -> 4 0s) OR same quantity but higher digit (e.g., 3 5s -> 3 6s).\n- Instead of bidding, you can challenge the current bid by saying 'CHALLENGE'. You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand. The current bid is only 3 5s. Bidding 4 6s seems reasonable, increasing both quantity and digit based on my hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 4 6s\"\n}\nExample 2 (Challenging):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The current bid is 11 8s. With only 16 total digits in play, this seems extremely unlikely, even if I have one 8. I should challenge.\",\n  \"action\": \"CHALLENGE\"\n}\nEnsure the 'action' value is *exactly* 'BID: [quantity] [digit]s' or 'CHALLENGE'. IMPORTANT: Do not include any text or Markdown formatting outside the JSON. Only return the JSON object.",

Looking at my hand, 85989727, I notice I have no 0s but multiple 7s and 9s. Since I have to increase either the quantity or the digit, and considering the distribution of digits in my hand, bidding on a digit I have in abundance seems wise. I have two 7s and two 9s, but since the bid needs to be higher than 2 0s, I could bid on either of these digits if I had more of them. However, I only have two of each. Thus, the safest increase would be to bid on the highest digit I have, considering the low quantity I can confirm. Bidding 2 7s or 2 9s would be a direct increase in digit value without overcommitting, given I only have two of each. Between 7 and 9, 9 is the higher digit, so I should bid on that to maximize my chances, assuming the other player might also have some but not excessively so.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 9s\"\n}",
