You can only challenge the immediately preceding bid.\n- If a bid is challenged, the actual count of the digit is revealed. If count >= bid quantity, the bidder wins. If count < bid quantity, the challenger wins.\n- The maximum possible quantity for any digit is 16.\nOutput Format:\nRespond with a valid JSON object containing 'reasoning' and 'action' keys.\nExample 1 (Making a bid):\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two 6s in my hand.

                    "reasoning": "\nOkay, so I'm playing Liar's Poker, and it's my turn. The current bid is None, which means I need to make the first bid. Let me look at my hand: 31534502. Let me write down the digits and count them.\n\nDigits in my hand:\n- 3 appears twice (positions 1 and 4)\n- 1 appears once (position 2)\n- 5 appears twice (positions 3 and 6)\n- 4 appears once (position 5)\n- 0 appears once (position 7)\n- 2 appears once (position 8)\n\nSo, in my hand, the digits and their counts are:\n3: 2\n1: 1\n5: 2\n4: 1\n0: 1\n2: 1\n\nSince I'm the first to bid, I can choose any digit and quantity. But I should consider the possible digits in the opponent's hand as well. The maximum total for any digit is 16 (since each player has 8 digits, 2 players make 16 total digits).\n\nLooking at my hand, the digit 3 appears twice, and 5 appears twice. Maybe I can bid on one of these. However, if I bid too high, the opponent might challenge if they think it's unlikely.\n\nLet me think about which digit to choose. Maybe starting with a lower quantity but a higher digit. For example, if I bid 3 3s, that means I'm claiming there are at least three 3s in total. Since I have two 3s, the opponent could have one. That seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 3 5s, but I have two 5s, so the opponent would need to have at least one 5. That's also possible. But maybe starting with a lower digit is safer.\n\nWait, the rules say that a bid must be strictly higher than the current bid. Since the current bid is None, I can choose any quantity and digit. But I should make a bid that's not too easy to challenge.\n\nIf I bid 3 3s, that's a reasonable starting point. It's not too high, and since I have two 3s, the opponent only needs to have one more for the total to be three. That seems plausible.\n\nAnother option is to bid on a digit I don't have, but that might be riskier. For example, if I bid 2 7s, but I don't have any 7s, I'm hoping the opponent has two. But that's a bit of a gamble.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid a higher digit with a lower quantity. For example, 3 9s. But since I don't have any 9s, that's a big risk. The opponent might not have any either, making it likely to lose if challenged.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think starting with a bid on a digit I have multiple of is safer. Bidding 3 3s seems reasonable because I have two, and the opponent might have one. It's a moderate bid that's not too high, making it less likely to be challenged immediately.\n\nWait, but what if the opponent has zero 3s? Then the total would be two, which is less than my bid of three. That would mean I lose if challenged. Hmm, that's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, I could bid 2 3s. But since the current bid is None, I can make a higher bid. Maybe 3 3s is still a good starting point, but I should be cautious.\n\nAnother approach: look at the digits I have and see which ones are more likely to appear in the opponent's hand. For example, if I have two 3s, it's possible the opponent has one or none. But if I have two 5s, maybe the opponent also has some 5s.\n\nWait, but since I'm making the first bid, I have to consider that the opponent might not have any of that digit. So, maybe starting with a lower quantity is better. But the rules say the bid must be strictly higher than the current bid, which is None, so I can choose any quantity and digit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should bid on a digit that's less likely to be in the opponent's hand. For example, if I have a 0, maybe the opponent has fewer 0s. But I don't know that for sure.\n\nWait, in my hand, I have a 0. So, the total number of 0s could be 1 or more, depending on the opponent. If I bid 2 0s, that's possible, but again, the opponent might not have any.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should stick with a digit I have multiple of, like 3 or 5.\n\nLet me think again: if I bid 3 3s, I have two, so the opponent needs one. If they have one, total is three, which meets the bid. If they have none, total is two, which is less than the bid, so I lose if challenged.\n\nBut since I'm the first to bid, maybe it's better to make a bid that's not too high. Alternatively, I could bid 4 3s, but that's a higher risk because I have only two.\n\nWait, no, the quantity must be higher than the current bid, which is None. So I can choose any quantity, but it's better to make a bid that's reasonable.\n\nI think I'll go with 3 3s. It's a moderate bid, and I have two of them, so it's plausible that the opponent has at least one.\n"
