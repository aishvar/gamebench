The total count of '3's across both hands is at least 1 (mine) + unknown (opponent's). The bid history shows a pattern of low counts for digits 0 through 3. Given that I have one '3', it's plausible that the total count of '3's is at least 2, but it's unlikely to be much higher than that since my opponent is likely to have at most 1 or 2 '3's. To continue the game, I need to bid higher than 2 3s. The next possible bid is either a higher quantity of '3's or the same quantity of a higher digit. I can bid 3 3s or 2 4s. Since I'm not confident in having more than one '3', bidding 3 3s might be too aggressive. However, bidding 2 4s is a safer option as it doesn't require me to have any knowledge of the '4's in my opponent's hand.\",\n  \"action\": \"BID: 2 4s\"\n}\n```",
